Stanford BIOE.80 Spring 2018					Assigned: 13 April 2018

**Problem Set Week-2 **

**DUE:** Friday 1:30p 20 April 2018 (i.e., start of class via Canvas)

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problems must be completed individually unless explicitly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas

**Goals:** Reflect on the engineering design cycle: Design, Build, and Test (DBT) and its role in Bioengineering. Prepare you for quantitative estimations in living matter (both related to what makes living matter unique and DBT cycles).

**(Q1) MOSIS (the shared implementation service heard 'round the world')**** **(20 pts)

While many of you may not have heard of Mosis prior to this course, you have probably - in one way or another - benefited from its existence. How, you ask? As you recall, [Mosis](https://www.mosis.com/) (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) is a product of the VLSI revolution that changed the way we make the chips that power all of our electronics today. 

Before the advent of this shared implementation service, researchers and others looking to prototype and/or fabricate a chip had to be much more personally involved in the process of fabrication. Making masks was unreliable, which produced poor wafers. The best results came when you knew someone in the fab facility, and could tailor your design to their skills. In other words, there was a lack of standardization and a centralization of designing and building that increased latency and cost. Recognizing a need, the clever minds behind Mosis sought to help lower these barriers to entry (cost, specialized knowledge, access to a foundry, etc). 

In doing so, they created the "fabless foundry" industry that has helped shape our society today. Watch this** **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5SEFE_49Ug)** **made by Mosis explaining the workflow for using their service. As you do, pay special attention to each step of the workflow, who is involved, and which part of the DBT cycle is shown.

**Q.1.a. **How does this compare (similarities and differences) to the DBT cycle you saw with KumaMax? Fill in the following table to compare and contrast the DBT workflow in each case, highlighting who is responsible for each step, and what tools they use in the completion of this task.

Engineering living matter has not yet undergone the same type of decoupling and standardization of different aspects of the DBT cycle that ushered in massive change in other fields (standardization of screws, outsourcing chip fabrication with Mosis). People who want to make customized DNA often have to do so own their own, spending months to construct and validate a single piece of a DNA sequence. Recently, with the commercialization of DNA synthesis technologies, it has become possible to order customized genes, but this process is expensive. 

As we saw in class, the [Free Genes Project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/) wants to bring ideas of decoupling and the "fabless foundry" to the engineering of DNA.

**Q.1.b.** Compare this to the Mosis workflow outlined above. How the Free Genes Project similar or different?  (<150 words)

**Q.1.c. **Go to company websites and determine in which "sector" they are situated (D, B, or T) and what do they do:

* **[Twist Bioscience**s](https://twistbioscience.com/company/about)

* **[Ginkgo Biowork**s](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/)** **

* **[Amyri**s](https://amyris.com/)

* **[EnEvol**v](http://enevolv.com/platform/)

* **[Bolt Thread**s](https://boltthreads.com/)

**Q.1.d.** Thinking to the future, if more and more Design, Build, and Test companies blossom in industry, what would be the role of the researcher? Could you outsource a research project and would it be cheaper / faster? Is that good? (<200 words)

**(Q2) Approximate and rapid numerical estimates** (20 pts)

Approximations based on simple physical principles are known as Fermi problems. These problems will help you build quantitative intuition. This quantitative intuition will help you during the DBT cycle (estimating feasibility). Most of these estimates are rough: they are designed to give you a broad, order of magnitude intuition for the biology, so keep in mind that that the exactly correct number could be different. Give your answers to two significant figures and provide units where appropriate. You should only need simple math and arithmetic; a couple of lines of work at most. (Additional resources: bionumbers is an excellent source for biological numbers [link](http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/) . "*Cell Biology by the Numbers" *is a great book on estimation problems in biology You can get a free copy of the draft version here: [link](http://book.bionumbers.org/))

*Escherichia coli* is well-studied bacteria considered to be representative of how bacterial systems work generally (i.e., a 'model' organism). *E. coli* is also easy to grow in the lab and divides rapidly (about 20 mins) . As a result, *E. coli* is frequently used in bioengineering.

**_Figure 1._*** E. coli* is shaped like a rod, which we can approximate as a spherocylinder: a cylinder with hemispherical caps. (Of note, MG1655 is a strain derived from a lineage of *E. coli* variants that was originally isolated from a diphtheria patient at the Palo Alto hospital in 1922.)

**Q.2.a.** Based on a spherocylinder model,** **calculate the volume of an *E. coli* cell. 

**Q.2.b.** If an *E. coli* cell were the size of a building, how big would a water molecule be?

 

**Q.2.c. ** The mean diameter of a protein is roughly 4 nm. What is the upper bound on how many proteins could fit inside an *E. coli* cell?

**Q.2.d**. How would you go about estimating the total number of carbon atoms in an *E.coli* cell? You don't have to calculate this just define variables and describe your approach step by step. 

**(Q3) GOOP Tube activity**  (30 pts)

On Friday you were given two GOOP tubes, one tube of DNA (instruction to express GFP), 

and one tube of water.

**Q.3.a.** When and where did you add the water and DNA-expression to your GOOP tube. 

**Q.3.b.** Did the GOOP with expression instructions turn green (produce GFP)? How long did it take? (Your grade does not depend on the expression of GFP)

Include photos of both tubes at the start, about 6 hours and after 12 hours. (Time points don't have to be exact. Simply report when you took the photos) Make sure to provide a figure legend. 

**Q.3.c.** Why might certain designs work in GOOP, but not in a cell? Why might certain designs work in a cell, but not in GOOP? (<150 words)

**Q.3.d.** During class on Wednesday you practiced ordering a gene, without having to build it. Imagine that you could have received a DNA sequence that you designed from Free Genes. Pick one task you wish that DNA to perform and describe it in words or a diagram without providing a sequence (example: to detect lead in the water and produce a reporter pigment or fluorescent protein). You can use this website for inspiration [link](http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page)

Do you think you would be able to use GOOP to test your designs? (<150 words)

**_Feedback: Please give us feedback. Did you run into any problems? Do you have suggestions or comments? _**

**(Q4) Revisiting Design Tools (PyMol).**** ** (20 pts)

**Q.4.a. **Check out the website where the GFP structure is housed: [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl). What is the experimental method used to get the structure of the protein? What is the listed resolution of the structure? (<150 words)

**Q.4.b.** Add a screenshot of your GFP structure in PyMol with the chromophore highlighted in red. Why do you think the barrel structure might be necessary around the chromophore? (<150 words) (Hint: think about how the barrel structure might help the chromophore maturation process)

**Q.4.c**. Find a structure on PDB for a fluorescent protein with emission wavelength *redder *than GFP. Render that structure in PyMol and highlight its chromophore. What are the structural similarities between the structure of the fluorescent protein and GFP, if any? What are the qualitative differences between the chromophore of your selected protein and that of GFP?

**(Q5) When are we 'done'?**** ** (10 pts)

A crucial skill is determining when we are ready to exit the DBT cycle (if ever). This can be determined by a number of things, such as access to resources, allotted time, and meeting certain metrics of success. It can be challenging to know when you have found the proper balance of all of these. Luckily, our old friend DBT provides a guide to help with these considerations. That is what the Test part is all about: helping you determine when you have succeeded. 

Let's look at a real example of Test in action. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ&feature=youtu.be), and answer the following questions.

**Q.5.a. **Are you surprised by the video? Why do you think the company behind this video wanted to share their testing process with the world? (<150 words)

**Q.5.b.** Can you guess what some of the design specifications and testing benchmarks were from the video? (<150 words)

Working from our design specifications and field standards, we can outline an acceptable margin of error. Once we get to a product that is within this range, we can say that we have succeeded and exit the cycle. But this is context, specific.

**Q.5.c.** How would you determine acceptable margins of error in the cases we have seen. Think about the stakeholders (who would be affected by a failure of the product), and how they would be impacted. Which do you think would have a larger margin of error? Why? (<150 words)

1. KumaMax: Creating an oral enzyme therapeutic to treat Celiac Disease:

2. Mosis: Building integrated circuits that are faithful to user-specified design.

3. The Free Genes Project: DNA Synthesis

4. Falcon Heavy: Building a privately-funded rocket

By releasing videos of their failed launches, which include detailed annotations of which system failed the SpaceX team is reminding us that success can only be achieved after repeated failures. It is part of the process. They show us how to fail properly. 

**Final Note: **This week you explored the concepts behind Design-Build-Test. You also practiced DBT in the context of design tools for living matter (pyMol), decoupled build from design (ordered a gene to be synthesized), and tested a DNA device (via GOOP). 

DBT is an essential framework that you will apply to many (bio)engineering challenges. 

You will explore and practice DBT in many BIOE classes: BIOE 44 (Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab), BIOE 123 (Biomedical System Prototyping Lab), and BIOE 141 A and B (Senior Capstone Design). 

Next week we will learn more about what exactly happens when you order a gene (DNA synthesis) and how we can 'read' DNA sequences (sequencing) and **What arises from DNA read/write trends that will matter for the rest of our lives?**
