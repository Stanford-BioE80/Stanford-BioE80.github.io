Welcome to the pre-class material for Stanford Intro. to Bioengineering Day 4!

Please read and consider the below before start of class on: 

**Wednesday 11 April 2018.**

The questions given are only study questions not homework to be answered.

Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

How do engineers actually engineer with, of, and for biology?

* * *


Here, you will continue your examination of the Design-Build-Test process and how it can be used to engineering with, of, and for living matter. For reference, here are the goals for the material this week (provided in the pre-class material for Monday):

**Goal-1:** You will be able to describe the engineering cycle, design-build-test (DBT), and the central role it plays in (bio)engineering, and how DBT can be utilized at different scales (from one person to whole industry sectors).

**Goal-2 :** When faced with a challenge, you will be able to articulate your goal, 

specify your design needs, and develop a plan for designing, building, and testing your 

solution.

**Goal-3: **By the end of this week, you will be able to describe the DBT framework as a dynamic process in response to the current needs (social, technological, environmental, etc.), and begin to consider what DBT will look like in the future.

## **Example 1 | Mosis: the shared implementation service heard 'round the world**

* * *


While many of you may not have heard of Mosis, you have probably - in one way or another - benefited from its existence. How, you ask?

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/m12WHkrXESrY2IzhocR3xw_img_0.png)

[Mosis](https://www.mosis.com/) (MEtal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) is a product of the VLSI revolution that changed the way we make the chips that power all of our electronics today. But *how* did it pave the way for this drastic change? 

Before the advent of this shared implementation service, researchers and others looking to prototype and/or fabricate a chip had to be much more personally involved in the process of fabrication. Making masks was unreliable, which produced poor wafers. The best results came when you knew someone in the fab facility, and could tailor your design to their skills. In other words, there was a lack of standardization and a centralization of designing and building that increased latency and cost. 

Recognizing a need, the clever minds behind Mosis (Danny Cohen) sought to help lower these barriers to entry (cost, specialized knowledge, access to a foundry, etc). In doing so, they created the "fabless foundry" industry that has helped shape our society today.

**Watch this ****[vide**o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5SEFE_49Ug)** made by Mosis explaining the workflow for using their service. As you do, pay special attention to each step of the workflow, who is involved, and which part of the DBT cycle is shown.**

**Q.X. How does Mosis work? Specifically, what key feature makes this service better than others that had previously been used?**

% Multi-Project Wafers

% Enables many different designs onto one mask set, which are subsequently cut into one 

% die (one for each design).

**Q.X. If I am designing a chip, what advantage does Mosis provide? Why would I choose to use it?**

% Pre-MPW - one designer (for example a grad student prototyping a chip) had to fill the 

% whole wafer, aggregate orders with colleagues, or make it themself. 

% This outsources labor to factories using standardized schedule + processing **

% Brings the cost of trial and error way down because each individual prototype is much less 

% expensive

**Q.X. How does this differ from the DBT cycle we saw with KumaMax? Fill in the following table to compare and contrast the DBT workflow in each case.**

As we have seen, engineering with biology has not yet undergone the same type of decoupling and standardization of difference aspects of the DBT cycle that ushered in massive change in other fields (standardization of screws, outsourcing chip fabrication with Mosis). But, wait! We are on the cusp of a revolution!

## **Example 2 | The Free Genes Project: A synthetic biology shared implementation service?**

* * *


Not too long ago, people who wanted to make customized DNA had to do so with their own two hands, spending months and months to construct and validate a single piece of a larger DNA sequence. Then, with the commercialization of DNA synthesis technologies, it was possible to order your favorite customized gene, but you had to pay the big bucks. 

Now, the [Free Genes Project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/) wants to bring ideas of decoupling and the "fabless foundry" to the engineering of DNA. ……

Q.X. Go to the Free Genes Project website, and describe how it works. Who is responsible for which aspect?

Q.X. Compare this to the Mosis workflow outlined above. How is it similar or different? 

Q.X. **Need more questions….just want to get them excited about the idea of being about facile/inexpensive outsourcing of DNA 'construction'/’fab’.
