shoes must cover the entire foot and pants must cover the ankle.Please leave food and drinks on the cart outside.


### Introduction:
Welcome to the Making with Mushrooms activity!
Our goal is to help you discover and get you inspired by the potential of living matter asa material.
In class goal: Make your own mycelium material object.
To complete this activity you will first make your own mycelium material.
Finally, you are asked to document and share your images as part of your PSET-8.


### Make your own mycelium material object:
If you would like a video tutorial please visit the MycoWorks Website [MycoWorks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=c6nurN-Hii8). 
TAs will be available during the activity (Shriram 112 and 132) session to help you with making your mycelium material object. You can also explore theseInstructables on making mycelium objects [making mycelial forms](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mycelial-Forms/), [making mycelium](https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Mycelium/), and making mycelium molds [making mycelium molds](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mycelium-Molds/).


### Materials
please check to see if you have all these items at your table:
2 large bowls, small bags/plastic wrap, cups, mushroom material, sharpie/tape
Molds are available

### Procedure

#### Set up 
(suggested time: 10 min)

1. Put on gloves!

2. Spray and wipe down your forms/molds.

3. Break the antlers off, if there are any, to get to the spongy layer. Put theantlers in one bowl and the spongy material in the other.

4. Squeeze out the juice from the spongy material into the antler bowl in orderto get a damp but not wet material, leaving it in its original bowl. This will beyour final material. Your damp material should have no excess water (i.e. kindof like wet sand).

#### Build 
(suggested time: 15 min)
