## Friday In Class: Making with Mushrooms
**Think it |  Shape it |  Grow it |  Build it**

Recall from the safety training that the UTL space (our undergraduate learning labspace) requires that 
shoes must cover the entire foot and pants must cover the ankle.Please leave food and drinks on the cart outside.


### Introduction:
Welcome to the Making with Mushrooms activity!
Our goal is to help you discover and get you inspired by the potential of living matter asa material.
In class goal: Make your own mycelium material object.
To complete this activity you will first make your own mycelium material.
Finally, you are asked to document and share your images as part of your PSET-8.


### Make your own mycelium material object:
If you would like a video tutorial please visit the MycoWorks Website [MycoWorks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=c6nurN-Hii8). 
TAs will be available during the activity (Shriram 112 and 132) session to help you with making your mycelium material object. You can also explore theseInstructables on making mycelium objects [making mycelial forms](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mycelial-Forms/), [making mycelium](https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Mycelium/), and making mycelium molds [making mycelium molds](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mycelium-Molds/).


### Materials
please check to see if you have all these items at your table:
2 large bowls, small bags/plastic wrap, cups, mushroom material, sharpie/tape
Molds are available

### Procedure

#### Set up 
(suggested time: 10 min)

1. Put on gloves!

2. Spray and wipe down your forms/molds.

3. Break the antlers off, if there are any, to get to the spongy layer. Put theantlers in one bowl and the spongy material in the other.

4. Squeeze out the juice from the spongy material into the antler bowl in orderto get a damp but not wet material, leaving it in its original bowl. This will beyour final material. Your damp material should have no excess water (i.e. kindof like wet sand).

#### Build 
(suggested time: 15 min)

5. Think of something you would like to build, perhaps the idea you came inwith or the object or part you wanted to mold.

6. Shape the material! Here are three ways to do so:
  a.With your hands!
  b.Around an object!
  c.In a baggy or cup!
  
7. Seal it! You can either put it in a plastic bag, plastic wrap, or cup.

*Remember, you want to LOOSELY SEAL your bag to allow for gas exchange so that the material can harden.*

#### Finish 
(suggested time: 10 min)

8. Label the bag/cup and ask your TA where to place it.

9. As a team, clean up your space completely. leaving the space better than you found it. 
To do so:

a. Take all biomaterials and anything that touched biomaterial (e.g. trash bag coverings on the tables in 112) and place them in the trash.

b. Wipe down your countertops with ethanol.

c. Please clean your bowls in the sink after dumping the mushroom wastematerial in the trash bins. Please give your bowl to a TA afterwards forstorage.


####  Guiding questions to think about as you make

These questions will be part of your PSET.

**Q.1** What is actually going on here? Describe in broad terms what processesunique to living matter are making this possible and the potential/limitation ofmaking with mushrooms.

**Q.2** How is this similar or different to other additive manufacturing processes suchas 3D printing? (detail out similarities/differences...feel free to draw)

**Q.3** Looking forward, how do we go from creating matter with an inert function(e.g. a chair) to creating matter with biological function (i.e. growing a finger, aheart, etc)? What new considerations need to be made?
