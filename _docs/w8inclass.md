## Friday In Class: Dancing Droplets 

Dear ENGR/BIOE.80ers,

Your practical goal for class today is to gain experience programing the behavior of simple 
systems in space and time. 

**Introduction**

Our specific goal is linked to gaining experience and asking questions about this week’s fundamental bioengineering 
concepts, including:

How simple actions can lead to complex behaviors,

How patterns and behavior can be encoded implicitly or across a distributed system,

How external physical forces can interact with simple agents to realize shape and form.

To explore these concepts we are challenging you to realize three types of behaviors that illustrate the three modes 
of patterning.

First, a pattern that you control directly by your own hand marking a path.

Second, a pattern that you control somewhat indirectly, by using spontaneous physical processes to create an external coordinate system.

Third, a pattern that you initiate but that otherwise entirely controls itself via its own autogeneration of a coordinate 
system.

To get started (if you havent already) please spend ~5 minutes watching these two videos:

**MATERIALS & METHODS**

Materials: glass slides, sharpie, colored solutions, pipettes and tips. There should also be a sheet of white paper on 
your work surface. Also grab pairs of gloves.

We have prepared the following solutions of propylene glycol and water (% v/v)

30% (Purple), 
15% (Teal), 
5% (Orange), 
2.5% (Pink).

A few notes on the glass slides and cleanliness:

To preserve the cleanliness of the slides and help the activity work properly, please do not touch the slide 
surface with your gloved hands. Hold the slide from the side.

We will have TAs operating a corona treatment for you; this makes the glass slides both incredibly clean and 
hydrophilic.

Now, practice by playing with making droplets dance:

• Place the slide on the paper work surface, with the marked treated side facing UP.

• Place small volumes (< 5 uL) of varying solutions of propylene glycol and colored water onto the slides 
using pipettes.

• Observe. The droplets should start moving.

• To gain additional controls over the system, you can draw on the slides with sharpie markers.
Ask questions or ask for help as needed!

When you feel ready...

**Three Challenge**

### Challenge 1.( ~ 5-7 minutes)
Can you get one droplet to chase another along a curved path between two points? (Hint: Sharpie)

### Challenge 2. (~ 10-12 minutes)
Can you get one droplet to follow a defined pathwithoutusing the black sharpie, only by placing other droplets in the field of play? How few “control” droplets can you use?

### Challenge 3. (All remaining time)
By only placing droplets in a confined initial region, can you get a droplet to eject and follow a defined path (again, all without placing any droplets elsewhere in the field)?

Note: Take pictures to help you answer the problem set questions. 

*** QUESTIONS ***

These questions will also appear shortly on PSET (here they are in advance):

— If you have two different droplets why do they chase each other? What other behaviors have you observed?

— Why does the sharpie marker create a physical barrier and how do the droplets respond to it?

— To what extent were you able to realize increasingly autonomous behavior?

— How good do we have to become at implementing these different frames of reference in order to engineer living matter?
