Dear ENGR/BIOE.80ers,

Your practical goal for class today (Friday 4 May 2018) is to gain experience programing the behavior of simple 
systems in space and time. 

**Introduction**

Our specific goal is linked to gaining experience and asking questions about this week’s fundamental bioengineering 
concepts, including:

— how simple actions can lead to complex behaviors,

— how patterns and behavior can be encoded implicitly or across a distributed system,

—how external physical forces can interact with simple agents to realize shape and form.

To explore these concepts we are challenging you to realize three types of behaviors that illustrate the three modes 
of patterning.

First, a pattern that you control directly by your own hand marking a path.

Second, a pattern that you control somewhat indirectly, by using spontaneous physical processes to create an external coordinate system.

Third, a pattern that you initiate but that otherwise entirely controls itself via its own autogeneration of a coordinate 
system.

To get started please spend ~5 minutes watching these two videos:

**MATERIALS & METHODS**

Materials: glass slides, sharpie, colored solutions, pipettes and tips. There should also be a sheet of white paper on 
your work surface. Also grab pairs of gloves.

We have prepared the following solutions of propylene glycol and water (% v/v)
30% (Purple), 15% (Teal), 5% (Orange), 2.5% (Pink)

A few notes on the glass slides and cleanliness:

To preserve the cleanliness of the slides and help the activity work properly, please do not touch the slide 
surface with your gloved hands. Hold the slide from the side.

We will have TAs operating a corona treatment for you; this makes the glass slides both incredibly clean and 
hydrophilic.

Now, practice by playing with making droplets dance:

• Place the slide on the paper work surface, with the marked treated side facing UP.

• Place small volumes (< 5 uL) of varying solutions of propylene glycol and colored water onto the slides 
using pipettes.

• Observe. The droplets should start moving.

• To gain additional controls over the system, you can draw on the slides with sharpie markers.
Ask questions or ask for help as needed!

When you feel ready...

**3 Challenge**

###Challenge 1.( ~ 5 minutes)
Can you get one droplet to chase another along a curved path between two points? (Hint: Sharpie)
