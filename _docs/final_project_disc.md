# BIOE 80 Final Project (15% of Grade)
## Why is Bioengineering Important?

The final project is the opportunity for you, as part of a group,  to introduce a non-expert audience to Bioengineering.   One goal of BIOE.80 is to introduce you, the learner, to Bioengineering and enable you to introduce other learners to Bioengineering.  In the course, we discussed capacities of living matter, application of scientific concepts (e.g., evolution and diffusion), contemporary topics (DNA sequencing and synthesis), challenges, and opportunities in Bioengineering.  The final project enables you to practice this task, apply what you have learned, and seek and identify areas that are of interest to you. 

The goal of this group project is for BIOE.80 students to communicate and introduce the application of Bioengineering to contemporary challenges to a non-expert audience, for example, next year's BIOE.80 class.

In groups of 3-4, students will create a "BIOE 80 Wiki Post" identifying a current need and discussing the role that Bioengineering can take in developing solutions.

Student groups will create a Google Doc, Google Site, Github website or any world-readable webpage with a vignette about Bioengineering.
Each of this quarter's pre-class material can be considered a sample project.

Assessment will be based on the following:

**Identification and Description of Need:** 20 points
* Instructors can offer suggested sources, ie: kiva.org
* Describe the problem and who is affected by it

**Description or proposal of bioengineering-based solution:** 20 points
* Provide relevant background for learning about the biology and technology utilized in the solution (ie: identify resources for getting more information)
* Describe advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this solution
* Describe what should happen for this solution to occur? (ie: development of technology, policy, etc.)

**Qualitative and quantitative feasibility assessment of the project** 15 points
* Back-of-the-envelope calculations can be required, ie: estimate of requirements and cost ost, estimate of impact (how many people would be impacted)
* Quantitative due diligence

**Description of Social Ramifications:** 15 points
* Ethical implications of taking action
* Ethical implications of inaction

**References:** 5 points
* Students should include citations, as appropriate (looking for a consistent style)

**Structure:** 10 points
* Clarity, Spelling, Grammar, etc.
* Appropriate use of visuals

**Group Participation:** 15 points
* Since this is a group project, each student will evaluate how much other students contributed to the project. 
Grades may differ between students within a group.

Total: 100 points

**Scaffolding, Logistics, and Milestones:**
* Assign each group a TA as a mentor
* Group formation and initial brainstorming by the end of **week 4**
* Problem identification by the end of **week 6**
* Required TA check-in during **week 8** 
* Project due Wednesday, June 5th (Final class session) **week 10** 
* Submit link to final material to the teaching team
* This takes the place of the Final Exam (15% of grade)
* To simplify other aspects problem sets can be shortened
