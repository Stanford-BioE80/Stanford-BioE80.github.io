**DUE:** Next Friday, beginning of class.

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations).

## (Q1) Health and Flourishing (20 points) 

Thinking back to the class on Monday, 

**Q.1.a.** What factors (i.e., changes) contributed to the reduction of deaths due to pneumonia and tuberculosis from 1900s-2000s? (bullet points)

Thinking back to the case study on the production Artemisinin,

**Q.1.b.** What were some of the major lessons from this case study? (2-3 bullet points)

## (Q2) Brainstorming Report  (45 pts)

**Q.2.a.**  Did you show up on Friday? (Yes / No)

**Q.2.b.**  Were you able to connect with your group? (Yes / No) Please share their names 

Drawing from your experiences in class Friday, 

Provide a brief summary of the activity. 

**Q.2.c.**  What audiences and topic did your group identify?

**Q.2.d.**  What audiences and topic did your group recieve? 

**Q.2.d.** Brainstorming report, based on the audience and topic combination - what mediums did you identify?

**Q.2.e.** Select one idea and further explore it (a paragraph, drawings, figures, and diagrams if necessary). 

## (Q3) Fantastic Voyage  (35 Points)

In the near future, you and your team are planning to remove an inoperable tumor from the brain of an important scientist.  You conclude that the only way that tumor can be destroyed is to remove it from the inside of the patient's own body. 
You imagine a submarine that can be shrunk and will carry the team of experts and doctors.  Sadly, however, no shrink ray exists in this future ([Fantastic Voyage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/)). 

Instead, you can begin to engineer living matter, microbes or patient's cells, that are already small. 

Briefly read the abstract of the paper titled [Acoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021), which enables imaging and control of living matter in mammalian hosts.

**Q.3.a.** In your own words summarize the abstract in 2-3 sentences. What is the main *claim* of this paper?

**Q.3.b.** According to the abstract what is the origin and purpose of the gas-filled protein nanostructures in nature?

**Q.3.c.** Think about another application for this system? (2-3 sentences)

**Q.3.d.** Find another example (for example a research paper or a news article) demonstrating the progress and state of engineering of living matter, microbes or mammalian cells, to detect or combat diseases that are of interest to you.  
Why did you select this example (link and 2-3 sentences)? 

**Your questions** Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

## Extra learning (100% optional):

### (Q4) Biodefense (0 points) 

Last year the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University ran a simulated exercise exploring and gaining experience with how our current society would respond to a new virus.  They named exercise [CladeX](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/). In such exercises, prior government officials with tremendous real-world expertise role play how the government might behave and respond to anemerging situation. Get a piece of note paper and load the video recording of their exercise here: [source](https://youtu.be/sJ1x8SlNxj0) 

First, watch from 7-11’ to get a sense of what is going on from the simulated news coverage.

Second, watch the person playing the part of the US National Security Council from 11’ to 14’.Take notes regarding the facts and figures related to the infection, its latency, its consequences,how long it will take to develop a vaccine, etc.

Third, watch the person playing the part of the expert from the Centers for Disease Control &Prevention (CDC) from 14’ to 15:30’ to get additional context.

*NOTE:* You do not need to watch the entire exercise (hours of video) to proceed.  Answer thefollowing based on the facts and figures gleaned from the <10’ of introductory video.

Develop back-of-the-envelope estimates for the following:

4.a. How many people will be infected by the virus?  Make and note whatever simplifyingassumptions you find useful (20 points).

4.b. How many people will die from the virus?  Make and note whatever simplifyingassumptions you find useful (20 points).

4.c. Based on your experience calculating your estimates, what one intervention would youwish for and why?  (Max 100 words, 10 points).
