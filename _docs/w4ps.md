**DUE:** Next Friday (May 3) beginning of class.

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations).

## (Q1) Health and Flourishing (20 points) 

Thinking back to the case study on the production of Artemisinin from Wednesday,

**Q.1.a.** What were some of the major lessons from this case study? (2-3 bullet points)

**Q.1.b.** The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2017 there were 219 million cases of malaria [source](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria). If 3g artemisinin are required per treatment of 1 individual, how many total grams of artemisinin are needed per year?

**Q.1.c.** Sweet wormwood plants can produce 70 kg of artemisinin/ha land, where ha is a hectare of land. How many total hectares of land would be needed to produce enough supply of artemisinin to treat all individuals suffering from malaria each year? Use your answer from Q.1.b. 

**Q.1.d.** Producing artemisinin via yeast can yield 25 g of artemisinin/liter. What volume of a fermentor do you need to produce enough supply of artemisinin to treat all individuals suffering from malaria each year? Use your answer from Q.1.b.

**Q.1.e.** Imagine that in the near future, you are the head of the WHO's Malaria Project. In this future, land usage has become a challenge for the production of artemisinin given need to grow food. You are presented with the following data: in order to feed the yeast reactor, you need to supply 1.6 kg sugar/liter (which yields 25 g artemisinin/liter). If you can produce 7500 kg sugar from 1 hectare, how many hectares of land would you need to produce enough artemisinin?

**Q.1.f.** As the head of the WHO's Malaria Project, would you make the switch? If yes, please explain why. If not, what would you want to see before considering a switch? 

## (Q2) Fantastic Voyage  (35 Points)

In the near future, you and your team are planning to remove an inoperable tumor from the brain of an important scientist.  You conclude that the only way that the tumor can be destroyed is to remove it from the inside of the patient's own body. 
You imagine a submarine that can be shrunk and will carry the team of experts and doctors.  Sadly, however, no shrink ray exists in this future ([Fantastic Voyage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/)). 

Instead, you can begin to engineer living matter, microbes or patient's cells, that are already small. 

Briefly read the abstract of the paper titled [Acoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021), which enables imaging and control of living matter in mammalian hosts.

**Q.2.a.** In your own words summarize the abstract in 2-3 sentences. What is the main *claim* of this paper?

**Q.2.b.** According to the abstract what is the origin and purpose of the gas-filled protein nanostructures in nature?

**Q.2.c.** Think about and describe another application for this system. (2-3 sentences)

Find another example (a research paper or a news article) demonstrating the progress and state of engineering of living matter, microbes or mammalian cells, to detect or combat diseases that are of interest to you.

**Q.2.d.** What is the main *claim* of your paper (link and 2-3 sentences)? 

**Q.2.e.** Why did you select this example ? (1-2 sentences)

## (Q3) Brainstorming Report  (45 pts)

This part must be completed individually

**Q.3.a.**  Did you show up on Friday? (Yes / No)

**Q.3.b.**  Were you able to connect with everyone in your group? (Yes / No) Please share their names. 

Drawing from your experiences in class Friday, 

**Q.3.c.**  What audience and topic did your group identify and write down on the index cards?

**Q.3.d.**  What audience and topic did your group receive? 

**Q.3.e.** Brainstorming report, based on the audience and topic combination - what mediums did you identify? (name 3 here)

**Q.3.f.** Select two mediums from your group brainstorm list and further explore them individually. In a paragraph describe how the medium serves the audience for a given topic. 

**Your questions or concerns** Do you have any unanswered questions or concerns (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

# Final Project - Group Activity.1 

**NOTES:** 

 - Due: Next Friday (May 03) beginning of class.
 - Include your group number and names of your group members.
 - Team Rules is 6 points of your Final Project.
 - Brainstorm is 30 points of your Final Project.
 - Please turn in a single electronic copy of your **Group Activity** via Gradescope. 
 
**Q.1.** What is your group number?  

**Q.2.** Turn in a copy of your team rules. We expect to see between 6 and 10 rules (5 rules < # rules < 11 rules) that you have all agreed upon. (6 points)

**Q.3.** Brainstorm report: As a group for your project brainstorm: topics, audiences, and methods. 
Here is our rubric for grading the brainstorming activity:

- Topic (10 points),  2 point per 10 ideas

- Audience (10 points),  2 point per 10 ideas

- Method (10 points), 2 point per 10 ideas

Next week we will work on evaluating the ideas.
