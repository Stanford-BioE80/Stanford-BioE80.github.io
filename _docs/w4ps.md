**DUE:** Next Friday, beginning of class.

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations).

## (Q1) Causes of death (50 points) 

Using the figures from the class and this [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/leading-causes-of-death-from-1900-2010-2012-6?op=1#and-here-it-is-all-laid-out-in-one-chart-deaths-per-100000-people-by-cause-1900-vs-2010-18)

1.a. What is the difference between the number of deaths due to pneumonia or influenza from 1900 to 2010?

1.b. What is the difference between the number of deaths due to cancer from 1900 to 2010?

1.c. What is the difference between the number of deaths due to heart disease?

1.d. Briefly (two sentences max) what factors (i.e., changes) 
contributed to the reduction ofdeaths due to pneumonia and tuberculosis?

1.e. Briefly (two sentences max) what factors (i.e., changes) contributed to the 
increase indeaths due to cancer and heart disease.

1.f. Using the aggregate (i.e., total) number of deaths per year per 100,000 people, w
hat do you estimate the average human lifespan to have been in 1900?  In 2010?  Does yourestimate make sense?

1.g. Given all of the preceding, provide an example of a challenge that the future of healthcare is facing 
(one sentence stating the challenge; a second sentence explainingwhy it will be a challenge)?

## (Q2) Biodefense (50 points) 

Last year the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University ran a simulated exercise exploring and gaining experience with how our current society would respond to a new virus.  They named exercise [CladeX](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/). In such exercises, prior government officials with tremendous real-world expertise role play how the government might behave and respond to anemerging situation. Get a piece of note paper and load the video recording of their exercise here: [source](https://youtu.be/sJ1x8SlNxj0) 

First, watch from 7-11’ to get a sense of what is going on from the simulated news coverage.

Second, watch the person playing the part of the US National Security Council from 11’ to 14’.Take notes regarding the facts and figures related to the infection, its latency, its consequences,how long it will take to develop a vaccine, etc.

Third, watch the person playing the part of the expert from the Centers for Disease Control &Prevention (CDC) from 14’ to 15:30’ to get additional context.

*NOTE:* You do not need to watch the entire exercise (hours of video) to proceed.  Answer thefollowing based on the facts and figures gleaned from the <10’ of introductory video.

Develop back-of-the-envelope estimates for the following:

2.a. How many people will be infected by the virus?  Make and note whatever simplifyingassumptions you find useful (20 points).

2.b. How many people will die from the virus?  Make and note whatever simplifyingassumptions you find useful (20 points).

2.c. Based on your experience calculating your estimates, what one intervention would youwish for and why?  (Max 100 words, 10 points).


## (Q4) Approximate and rapid numerical estimates (40 pts)

Approximations based on simple physical principles are known as Fermi problems. These problems will help you build quantitative intuition for working with biology. Most of these estimates are rough: they are designed to give you a broad, order of magnitude intuition for the biology, so keep in mind that that the exactly correct number could be different. Give your answers to two significant figures and provide units where appropriate. You should only need simple math and arithmetic; a couple of lines of work at most. 

Additional resources: bionumbers is an excellent source for biological numbers [link](http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/) . "_Cell Biology by the Numbers_" is a great book on estimation problems in biology. You can get a free copy of the draft version [here](http://book.bionumbers.org/).

_Escherichia coli_ (**Figure 1**) is well-studied bacteria considered to be representative of how bacterial systems work generally (i.e., a 'model' organism). _E. coli_ is also easy to grow in the lab and divides rapidly (about 20 mins). As a result, _E. coli_ is frequently used in bioengineering either as a model organism (to be studied or engineered directly) or as a host to generate large copies of user defined DNA. You will see (and setup your own in BIOE44) cultures tubes of _E. coli_ (with medium - food for bacteria) often growing overnight on shaking incubators (set to 37C) (**Figure 2**).

<i>E. coli</i> is shaped like a rod, which we can approximate as a spherocylinder: a cylinder with hemispherical caps. Of note, MG1655 is a strain derived from a lineage of <i>E. coli</i> variants that was originally isolated from a diphtheria patient at the Palo Alto hospital in 1922.

**Q.4.a.** Based on a spherocylinder model, calculate the volume of an _E. coli_ cell. 

**Q.4.b.** If an _E. coli_ cell were the size of a building, how big would a water molecule be?

**Q.4.c.** The mean diameter of a protein is roughly 4 nm. What is the upper bound on how many proteins could fit inside an *E. coli* cell?

**Q.4.d.** How would you go about estimating the total number of carbon atoms in an *E.coli* cell? You don't have to calculate this just define variables and describe your approach step by step. 


**Your questions** Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?
