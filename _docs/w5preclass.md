# Week 5 Preclass

Please read and consider the below before start of class on Monday.
The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction - Diffusion Happens

Welcome to the first pre-class material for Diffusion and Patterning.
The examples here will prepare you (and provide you with a mindset and a feeling) before the the class towards 
the following goals:

**Goal-1:** You will be able to recognize that diffusion is everywhere in biology and beyond.

**Goal-2:** You will be able to describe the mechanism behind diffusion (microscopically and macroscopically). 
Stated differently, you will be able to describe what does it mean that diffusion happens.

**Goal-3:** You will be able to describe the role and application of diffusion in engineering living matter.

Let's briefly learn about application of diffusion in engineering living matter with an interesting example of
**Blinking Squares** ...

## Case-1: Blinking Squares 

Here is a videos of 500 blinking squares. 
Each square is about 100μmx100μm and there are 25 μm gaps between each square. 
Each square contains about 5,000 bacterial cells. Watch the video

**Q.1. What do you observe?**

**Q.2. How long does it take for all the squares to synchronize (i.e., blink ON/OFF all together)?**

**Q.3. What is the simplest mechanism you can imagine that would cause all the squares to synchronize their blinking?**

**Q.4. Can the squares synchronize their blinking together without an external signal? If yes how would that signal synchronize the squares together?**

**Q.5. Can autonomous agents synchronize their behavior, and if so how?**


## Case-2: Blinking Square

Video goes here.
Here is a videos of a single blinking square (100μmx100μm) containing about approximately 5,000 cells.

**Q.6. What do you observe?**

**Q.7. What is the simplest mechanism you canimagine that would cause the square to synchronize its blinking?**

**Q.8. Watching  cells inside the square do you see a different brightness levels within each cell- how uniformed is the distribution of fluorescentproteins inside each individual cell in the square?**  

## What Is Diffusion

Diffusion is everywhere in living matter and beyond. We encounter diffusion routinely in our daily lives.

**Diffusion** is a spontaneous net movement of matter (e.g., molecules, atoms) from regions of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Stated differently, diffusion is a transfer of mass that causes the distribution of molecules, or atoms to be more uniform in space as time evolves. 

**Q.9.Can you think about everyday examples of diffusion in your life?**


## Is this Diffusion? 

Take a look at the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JuEomRki_M)

**Q.10. Is this diffusion? why or why not? How can you tell?**

## Preclass for Wednesday

Just a few minutes of your time spent on what following should get you ready for Wednesday's class.

We ended class on Monday with an initial consideration of diffusion, introducing the idea that spontaneous diffusion of systems comprised of more than one molecule can *temporarily* result in non-trivial spatial patterns (e.g., a bullseye).

Next we will build on both ideas.E.g,. how can state (i.e., memory) be used to capture and make permanent fleeting patterns?How can patterns build upon patterns?

We'll start by drawing again upon the preclass from Monday(i.e., the bacterial blinking oscillators) and end by working through a challenge of how to program the growth an arm-like structure.

Please ponder how cells can act... I.e., the various primary functions that cells can "execute" or carry out. 
By combining spontaneous physical processes starting from diffusion with programmed cellular functions, both natural and engineered biological systems can realize non-trivial behaviors over both space and time. More specifically:

### (1) Cells can grow and divide. 
I.e., one cell can become two and so on. 
[Cell Division - Exponential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x23n4zBOU8&feature=youtu.be)

### (2) Cells can move.
I.e., cell migration can result in significant changes in shape and form. Don't believe See a brand new movie of an immune cell moving inside the ear of a fish...
[Immune Cell Migration in the Zebrafish Inner Ear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz0VlUVjYfI&feature=youtu.be)

Or, a slime mold swarming on a plate and growing a stalk...

### (3) Cells cancommunicate with each other.
I.e., cells can send chemical messages between and among each other.
E.g., here's a type of "pulse" in gene expression generated across many cells during development of a tail-like structure...
[Wave of gene expression in an embryo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-fa1gYfwJk&feature=youtu.be)


### (4) Cells canchange state.
I.e., one type of cell can become another type of cell, in response to signals or even spontaneously.E.g., here are bacterial cells infected with virus realizing different cell-fate outcomes.
[Bacteriophage lambda lysis and lysogeny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLkZ9FPHJGM&feature=youtu.be)

### (5) Cells can undergo programmed cell death 
I.e., cells can die. Watch this cell die...
(need new video)

Taken together these functions can be used to realize incredible outcomes.E.g., watch this old-time movie of a frog egg becoming a frog.

**Question:How many of the five mechanisms introduced above can you observe or infer in the formation of a frog?**

***WHAT NEXT?***
We'll pick up from the abovetomorrowand you'll practice in reality the concepts learned Monday and Wednesday in Friday'sdancing droplets demo (which is absolutely amazing)...
