# Week 5 Preclass

Please read and consider the below before start of class on Monday.
The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction - Diffusion Happens

Welcome to the first pre-class material for Diffusion and Patterning.
The examples here will prepare you (and provide you with a mindset and a feeling) before the the class towards 
the following goals:

**Goal-1:** You will be able to recognize that diffusion is everywhere in biology and beyond.

**Goal-2:** You will be able to describe the mechanism behind diffusion (microscopically and macroscopically). 
Stated differently, you will be able to describe what does it mean that diffusion happens.

**Goal-3:** You will be able to describe the role and application of diffusion in engineering living matter.

Let's briefly learn about application of diffusion in engineering living matter with an interesting example of
**Blinking Squares** ...

## Case-1: Blinking Squares 

Here is a videos of 500 blinking squares. 
Each square is about 100μmx100μm and there are 25 μm gaps between each square. 
Each square contains about 5,000 bacterial cells. Watch the video

**Q.1. What do you observe?**

**Q.2. How long does it take for all the squares to synchronize (i.e., blink ON/OFF all together)?**

**Q.3. What is the simplest mechanism you can imagine that would cause all the squares to synchronize their blinking?**

**Q.4. Can the squares synchronize their blinking together without an external signal? If yes how would that signal synchronize the squares together?**

**Q.5. Can autonomous agents synchronize their behavior, and if so how?**


## Case-2: Blinking Square

Video goes here.
Here is a videos of a single blinking square (100μmx100μm) containing about approximately 5,000 cells.

**Q.6. What do you observe?**

**Q.7. What is the simplest mechanism you canimagine that would cause the square to synchronize its blinking?**

**Q.8. Watching  cells inside the square do you see a different brightness levels within each cell- how uniformed is the distribution of fluorescentproteins inside each individual cell in the square?**  

## What Is Diffusion

Diffusion is everywhere in living matter and beyond. We encounter diffusion routinely in our daily lives.

**Diffusion** is a spontaneous net movement of matter (e.g., molecules, atoms) from regions of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Stated differently, diffusion is a transfer of mass that causes the distribution of molecules, or atoms to be more uniform in space as time evolves. 

**Q.9.Can you think about everyday examples of diffusion in your life?**


## Is this Diffusion? 

Take a look at the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JuEomRki_M)

**Q.10. Is this diffusion? why or why not? How can you tell?**
