# Week 5 Preclass

Please read and consider the below before start of class on Monday.
The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.


## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction - Diffusion Happens

Welcome to the first pre-class material for Diffusion and Patterning.
The examples here will prepare you (and provide you with a mindset and a feeling) before the the class towards 
the following goals:

**Goal-1:** You will be able to recognize that diffusion is everywhere in biology and beyond.

**Goal-2:** You will be able to describe the mechanism behind diffusion (microscopically and macroscopically). 
Stated differently, you will be able to describe what does it mean that diffusion happens.

**Goal-3:** You will be able to describe the role and application of diffusion in engineering living matter.

Let's briefly learn about application of diffusion in engineering living matter with an interesting example 
of **Blinking Squares** ...

## Blinking Squares 

Here is a videos of 500 blinking squares. 
Each square is about 100μmx100μm and there are 25 μm gaps between each square. 
Each square contains about 5,000 bacterial cells. Watch the video

**Q.1. What do you observe?**

**Q.2. How long does it take for all the squares to synchronize (i.e., blink ON/OFF all together)?**

**Q.3. What is the simplest mechanism you can imagine that would cause all the squares to synchronize their blinking?**

**Q.4. Can the squares synchronize their blinking together without an external signal? If yes how would that signal synchronize the squares together?**

**Q.5. Can autonomous agents synchronize their behavior, and if so how?**
