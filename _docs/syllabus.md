## BIOE/ENGR.80 - Spring 2019

**_Introduction to Bioengineering (Engineering Living Matter)_**

Students successfully completing BIOE/ENGR.80 should have a working understanding for how to approach the systematic engineering of living systems to benefit all people and the planet. More specifically, our three main goals for the quarter are (1) to help you learn ways of thinking about engineering living matter, (2) to empower you to explore and do bioengineering starting from DNA, and (3) for you to become more capable of learning and explaining bioengineering to yourself and others, including discussing the broader ramifications of engineering the living world.

### Students with Documented Disabilities:

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).
