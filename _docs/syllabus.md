## BIOE/ENGR.80 - Spring 2020

**_Introduction to Bioengineering (Engineering Living Matter)_**

Students successfully completing BIOE/ENGR.80 should have a working understanding for how to approach the systematic engineering of living systems to benefit all people and the planet. More specifically our three main goals for the quarter are: (1) to help you learn ways of thinking about engineering living matter, (2) to empower you to explore and do bioengineering starting from DNA, and (3) for you to become more capable of learning about and discussing bioengineering with others, including the broader ramifications of engineering the living world.

### When

6 April to 10 June 2020

MWF, 1:30-2:20p, Lectures & Activities via Zoom

### Where

Zoom: [https://stanford.zoom.us/j/861034342?pwd=NkVXNUcwNVBKb1RCWnk3aTVydWJFQT09](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/861034342?pwd=NkVXNUcwNVBKb1RCWnk3aTVydWJFQT09)


### Instructors

Course Lead, Prof. Drew Endy; Office Hours MWF 2:20-3p (after class) and by appointment via [endy@stanford.edu](mailto:endy@stanford.edu) (can also schedule by emailing [marc4@stanford.edu](mailto:endy@stanford.edu))

Co-Instructor, Dr. Siavash Ahrar; Office Hours TBD; [sahrar@stanford.edu](mailto:sahrar@stanford.edu)

Co-Instructor, Prof. Michael Specter; Office Hours TBD; [specterm@stanford.edu](mailto:specterm@stanford.edu)

### Teaching Assistants

Lead TA, Jon Calles; Office Hours TBD; [jecalles@stanford.edu](mailto:jecalles@stanford.edu)

Lead Grader, Nicolai Ostberg; Office Hours TBD; [nostberg@stanford.edu](mailto:nostberg@stanford.edu)

Lead Student Liaison, Naomi Pacalin; Office Hours TBD; [npacalin@stanford.edu](mailto:npacalin@stanford.edu)

Lead Content Editor, Julisia Chau; Office Hours TBD; [jhchau@stanford.edu](mailto:jhchau@stanford.edu)

Digital Infrastructure Lead; Brianna Chrisman; Office Hours TBD; [briannac@stanford.edu](mailto:briannac@stanford.edu)

Digital Front-End Lead; Victor Tieu; Office Hours TBD; [vtieu@stanford.edu](mailto:vtieu@stanford.edu)

### Grading

The course is designed to operate on a S/NC basis.  To earn a S grade a student must satisfy the following two conditions:
 
(1)	Earn an average grade of 70% or above on the PSETS.

(2)	Earn a cumulative grade of 70% or above on the Final Project (team-based).

Please note your lowest PSET grade will be dropped from your PSET average.

Please also note that we will offer quizzes throughout the quarter that will accrue points.  You can apply your cumulative quiz points to reduce the threshold for (1) and (2) to as low as 60% given sufficient quiz points.

### Key Dates

6 April 2020; first class

25 May 2020; no class

10 June 2020; last class

### Honor Code

We expect you will uphold Stanford’s Honor Code. Discussion among peers and with the teaching staff is strongly encouraged. All submitted work must be completed individually unless explicitly noted otherwise.


### Students with Documented Disabilities:

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).
