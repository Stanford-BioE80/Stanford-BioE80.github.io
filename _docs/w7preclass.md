## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction: Evolving Better Biology | From Natural Algorithm to Engineering Service


This week you will examine the role of evolution from a Bioengineering perspective. 
After considering the following example and the material throughout this week you will be able to: 

**Goal-1:** Describe evolution as an algorithm that follows a set of rules.  

**Goal-2:** Utilize evolution as an algorithm. *“Evolution, at your service!”*:  
This robust algorithm is a service that can be deployed in diverse contexts. 

**Goal-3:** Describe the limitations when used as a service, and begin to describe what evolution 
could look like in the future *(“Evolution 2.0”)*.


**The Core concept for this week includes:** Evolution: Population, Diversity, Fitness, 
Selection (Pressure), Mechanics (Random Mutations), and Algorithm vs Service.

Before we begin briefly explore these: [link](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/evolution-13228138) 
and [link-2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/mutations-are-the-raw-materials-of-evolution-17395346)
to better appreciate these examples.


## Example-1: Why do you need to get a flu shot every year?

To begin, let us consider this past flu season. (Which was considered as the worst flu season since 2009-2010. 
See Figure-1.) 

Following is from an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-perfect-storm-behind-this-years-nasty-flu-season/550469/) 
published in January 2018: 

*“Every winter brings cautionary tales that the flu—just the regular old flu—can kill. And the cautionary tales this year are hard to beat. Twenty-one-year-old Kyler Baughman, for example, a fitness buff who liked to show off his six-pack, recently died a few days after getting a runny nose. [ref](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/11/kyler-baughman-pennsylvania-personal-trainer-dies-of-flu/)


According to the numbers, this year’s flu season is in fact worse than usual. It got started early, and it’s been more severe. Twenty kids have died of the flu since October. And in the week ending January 6, 22.7 out of every 100,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. were for flu—twice the number of the previous week.”* 


**ADD Figure-1: The flu season of 2017-2018 is the worst season since 2009-2010 **


Every year,  we are reminded to go get a flu shot. 

**Q.1. If you got a flu vaccine last year, why do you still have to get a flu shot again this year?**

**Q.2. What are the two populations that are interacting in the above story and graph?**

**Q.3.  How do new flu strains arise every year? Where do they come from?**
