## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction: Evolving Better Biology | From Natural Algorithm to Engineering Service


This week you will examine the role of evolution from a Bioengineering perspective. 
After considering the following example and the material throughout this week you will be able to: 

**Goal-1:** Describe evolution as an algorithm that follows a set of rules.  

**Goal-2:** Utilize evolution as an algorithm. *“Evolution, at your service!”*:  
This robust algorithm is a service that can be deployed in diverse contexts. 

**Goal-3:**Describe the limitations when used as a service, and begin to describe what evolution 
could look like in the future *(“Evolution 2.0”)*.


*The Core concept for this week includes:* Evolution: Population, Diversity, Fitness, 
Selection (Pressure), Mechanics (Random Mutations), and Algorithm vs Service.

Before we begin briefly explore these: [link](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/evolution-13228138) 
and [link-2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/mutations-are-the-raw-materials-of-evolution-17395346)
to better appreciate these examples.


## Example-1: Why do you need to get a flu shot every year?

To begin, let us consider this past flu season. (Which was considered as the worst flu season since 2009-2010. 
See Figure-1.)
