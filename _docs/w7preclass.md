## Preclass for Monday

## Introduction: Evolving Better Biology | From Natural Algorithm to Engineering Service


This week you will examine the role of evolution from a Bioengineering perspective. 
After considering the following example and the material throughout this week you will be able to: 

**Goal-1:** Describe evolution as an algorithm that follows a set of rules.  

**Goal-2:** Utilize evolution as an algorithm. *“Evolution, at your service!”*:  
This robust algorithm is a service that can be deployed in diverse contexts. 

**Goal-3:** Describe the limitations when used as a service, and begin to describe what evolution 
could look like in the future *(“Evolution 2.0”)*.


**The Core concept for this week includes:** Evolution: Population, Diversity, Fitness, 
Selection (Pressure), Mechanics (Random Mutations), and Algorithm vs Service.

Before we begin briefly explore these: [link](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/evolution-13228138) 
and [link-2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/mutations-are-the-raw-materials-of-evolution-17395346)
to better appreciate these examples.


## Example-1: Why do you need to get a flu shot every year?

To begin, let us consider this past flu season. (Which was considered as the worst flu season since 2009-2010. 
See Figure-1.) 

Following is from an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-perfect-storm-behind-this-years-nasty-flu-season/550469/) 
published in January 2018: 

“Every winter brings cautionary tales that the flu—just the regular old flu—can kill. And the cautionary tales this year are hard to beat. Twenty-one-year-old Kyler Baughman, for example, a fitness buff who liked to show off his six-pack, recently died a few days after getting a runny nose. [ref](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/11/kyler-baughman-pennsylvania-personal-trainer-dies-of-flu/)


According to the numbers, this year’s flu season is in fact worse than usual. It got started early, and it’s been more severe. Twenty kids have died of the flu since October. And in the week ending January 6, 22.7 out of every 100,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. were for flu—twice the number of the previous week.” 


**ADD Figure-1: The flu season of 2017-2018 is the worst season since 2009-2010**


Every year, we are reminded to go get a flu shot. 

**Q.1. If you got a flu vaccine last year, why do you still have to get a flu shot again this year?**

**Q.2. What are the two populations that are interacting in the above story and graph?**

**Q.3. How do new flu strains arise every year? Where do they come from?**

**Q.4. What causes the flu virus to change?**

Briefly examine the two following links:

1.[Why You Need the Flu Shot Every Year](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/smarter-living/why-you-need-the-flu-shot-every-year.html)
Let’s highlight to the following from above link: “Tiny mutations help the virus evade detection, and as it evades detection, it’s more successful at multiplying”.

2.[How the Flu Virus Can Change](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm)


An **algorithm** can be defined as:  
“A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.” (via Google) 

Given this definition, think about evolution in this new context.  

**Q.5. If evolution is an algorithm, what problem is being solved, and by whom(/what)? What are the rules?**

Extracting out the idea of Evolution from this example evolution is the results of two intertwined processes: Random Mutations beget genetic variation; non-random selection to improve “fitness”. The end result may look non-random, but the mechanism that enables evolution and natural selection to occur is entirely random. 


This example of flu virus highlights the algorithm of evolution acting on a *timescale* that is easy for us to understand.


## Example-2: Ancient virus genomes reveal complex evolution of Hepatitis B

In a fascinating [research article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/06/315531.full.pdf+html) see also ([article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/science/ancient-dna-bones-hepatitis.html)), “Scientists reported on Wednesday that they have recovered DNA from the oldest viruses known to have infected humans — and have succeeded in resurrecting some of them in the laboratory. The viruses were all strains of hepatitis B. Two teams of researchers independently discovered its DNA in 15 ancient skeletons, the oldest a farmer who lived 7,000 years ago in what is now Germany. Until now, the oldest viral DNA ever recovered from human remains was just 450 years old.” Here is the abstract from the article: 

“The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most widespread human pathogens known today,  yet its origin and evolutionary history are still unclear and controversial. Here, we report the analysis of three ancient HBV genomes recovered from human skeletons found at three  different archaeological sites in Germany. We reconstructed two Neolithic and one medieval  HBV genomes by de novo assembly from shotgun DNA sequencing data. Additionally, we observed HBV-specific peptides using paleo-proteomics. Our results show that HBV circulates in the European population for at least 7000 years. **The Neolithic HBV genomes show a high genomic similarity to each other. In a phylogenetic network, they do not group with any human-associated HBV genome and are most closely related to those infecting African non-human primates. These ancient virus forms appear to represent distinct lineages that have no close relatives today and went possibly extinct.** Our results reveal the great  potential of ancient DNA from human skeletons in order to study the long-time evolution of blood borne viruses.”

Note the highlighted lines from the abstract.

**Q.6. What is the role of evolution (as an algorithm) in this example?**

**Q.7. Thinking back to week-3, DNA read/write, what is the role of synthesis and sequencing in realizing this example?**


## Summary

Through these examples, you have started to synthesize the workings of evolution and natural selection into a streamlined algorithm. This week you will engage with this algorithm as a tool (and service) that can be used to solve challenges and problems in science/engineering and perhaps beyond?). In doing so, you will start to identify the current limitations of this deployment of evolution, and consider what it would mean to “improve” evolution.
