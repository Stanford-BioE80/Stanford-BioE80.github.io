## Cultural Flourishing (Citizenship & Humanity)

This week we will build on the concept of an emerging networked biology by asking and exploring a non-technical question:  What culture do we wish for?  Stated differently, as biology and bioengineering continue to undergo both quantitative and qualitative change, what will it mean to flourish as both individuals and as a collective society?  What might be needed in order to realize such flourishing?  

Our pre-class materials delve into tools and approaches that are used to structure relationships among people.  
Such tools are typically the domain of the political scientist, philosopher, lawyer, economist, writer, and so on. Thus, in introducing you to such approaches here, we aim to connect bioengineering to a broader context within which bioengineering occurs.
