## Analysis & Design of Molecules & Genetic Systems
Please read and consider the below before the start of each class.
The questions are study-questions and not homework to be graded.
Talk about anything you find interesting with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like, using Piazza or email the instructors!

## Preclass for Monday

### Activity â€“ Tools for seeing biology (Foldscope)

"If you want to know how nature works, (you) looked at it, carefully. Looking at it, that's the way it looks.  You don't like it? Go somewhere else, to another universe where the rules are simpler..." - Richard Feynman [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c&t=24m2s)

### Self-Assessment: 

Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device (a box) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! 
Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. 

Do you exclaim (choose one):

          DARN!!! 	COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? Remember your answer for the class. 

### Microscopes

Microscopes are a fantastic tool for exploring the beauty of living systems.  
In week-1's reading, you encountered Van Leeuwenhoek's simple yet powerful microscope.  Since Van Leeuwenhoek's time, building microscopes - that enable us to observe living matter across various scales - have been ongoing and exciting area research. 
Microscopes are routinely used by bioengineers to test, quantify, and visualize natural and engineered organisms. For example, you, as part of BIOE.44 (Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab), could build a genetic circuit in *E. coli* that produces green fluorescent proteins in response to environmental toxins such as lead or arsenic. Or you can build a genetic clock (oscillator) that expresses fluorescent proteins at predefined time frequencies. For both examples, you can use a fluorescent microscope to see, quantify, and test the operation of your engineered organisms.  

*Optional reading: Nobel prize in chemistry 2014, for the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy [How the optical microscope became a nanoscope](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-chemistryprize2014.pdf), and [Scientifc Background ](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2014.pdf).*

*Optional reading: Nobel prize in chemistry 2017, for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution [They captured life in atomic detail](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-chemistryprize2017.pdf), and [Scientifc Background ](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf)*

Despite the tremendous progress in microscopy, modern microscopes (for the most part) are expensive lab instruments that cannot easily be used or shared outside of labs. 

**Q.1. But what if you do not have access to a lab with a microscope?  
(Wouldn't it be nice to take your microscope with you wherever you go and explore the living matter?**  

**Q.2. How can we -as Bioengineers- enable all learners, explorers, and makers to have access to tools such as microscopes?**

### Foldscope

[Foldscope](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0098781) is a field-deployable paper origami microscope designed and built here at Stanford by Manu Prakash and his team. 

First, spend 10' and watch the Manu's TED talk on Foldscopes, [video-1](https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami#t-545437)

**Q.3. According to Manu, what are the problems with modern microscopes?**

**Q.4. According to Manu, what is the relationship between hands on science education tools and global health?**

Next, familiarize yourself with the global community of Foldscope users here at [Microcosmos(https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/)

**Putting your Foldscope together**

If you requested the BIOE.80 Education Kit and have received your Foldscopes follow the video instructions on [Foldscope Tutorials](https://www.foldscope.com/tutorials) or the written instruction inside the Foldscope kit to assemble your microscope. You can also find additional videos on how to use your Foldscope from the website. 

If you didn't ask for a Foldscope, don't worry.  You can still complete the problem set question without one.  

Build and bring your Foldscope to class on Monday and make sure to remember your answer to the Self-Assessment.  
Note: In previous years, this would take students between 30'-40'.

## Preclass for Wednesday

### Analysis and design of molecules 

Update opening here: On Monday we discussed tools to visulaize living matter. 

### Celiac Disease and KumaMax

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine that is triggered by eating gluten - a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye - and causes damage to the fingerlike projections lining your small intestine (villi) important for nutrient absorption ([Celiac Disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220)). 

It is estimated that 1% of the US population has celiac disease, but despite increasing attention in the media, almost 83% of those 3 million people remain undiagnosed (NOTE:  Beyond Celiac: What is Celiac Disease?). While misdiagnosis is common, some postulate that this lack of diagnosis (and awareness) can be linked to the limited clinical treatment offerings: currently, the only approved therapy is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Avoiding gluten can be difficult when there are hidden sources lurking around us (NOTE:  Medivizor: 300 facts you didn't know about gluten). Further, many who do adhere to a strict gluten-free diet do not see recovery of the small intestinal mucosa.

Recognizing the need for a true therapy, a 2011 undergraduate [iGEM](https://igem.org/Main_Page) team  from the University of Washington began to design a drug that could potentially provide relief. Six years later, that drug (KumaMax) was funded to undergo phase I clinical trials to the tune of $35 million.  

To learn more skim the following two websites:

[UW iGEM Wiki: Gluten Destruction](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Celiacs/Background)

**Q.1. According to the team's website, why had other approaches failed?**

**Q.2. What was unique about their approach?**

**Q.3. How did they choose their starting enzyme? What key design specification made this a great choice?**

**Q.4. How did they design their enzyme? What tools did they use?**

**Q.5. How did they test their enzyme?**

**Q.6. What would you have done differently?**

This example highlights the power of tools that enables us to visulaize and design molecules.  It also highlights the Design-Build-Test Cycle, a framework applied 


the DBT to a bioengineering challenge. The students began with an enzyme that, by correctly navigating a DBT process, they were able to engineer into modified form that could breakdown gluten in the gut.

**Summary**

In this pre-class activity you were introduced to the engineering cycle: design, build, and test and its application to bioengineering. You utilized a needs finding approach to identify design constraints, and specifications to describe your designs and corresponding tests. You examined the application of this approach to real world challenges. Finally you practiced an application of DBT framework through the Celiac disease case study. In class this week you will be introduced to how to actually design, build and test biomolecules.

**Keywords:**

**Design-Build-Test Cycle** - A framework that provides structure to the process of engineering a solution to diverse problems.

**Design** - Developing a possible solution. Informed by your design specifications. 

**Needs** - The specific problem you would like to solve. 

**Design Specifications** - How your solution will behave. For example: I'm building a paper plane for the purpose of nudging awake your friend across the room. This plane needs to:

- Fly straight for 5 feet
- Be smaller than 4 inches across (to be inconspicuous)
- Weigh less than one ounce (you don't want to hurt your friend)
- Be recyclable (because you love the earth)

**Build** - Making a prototype. I.e., make your design in real life. 

**Test** - Check whether your design, when turned into reality, actually satisfies all of requirements.
