## Analysis & Design of Molecules & Genetic Systems
Please read and consider the below before the start of each class.
The questions are study-questions and not homework to be graded.
Talk about anything you find interesting with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like, using Piazza or email the instructors!

## Preclass for Monday

### Activity â€“ Tools for seeing biology (Foldscope)

"If you want to know how nature works, (you) looked at it, carefully. Looking at it, that's the way it looks.  You don't like it? Go somewhere else, to another universe where the rules are simpler..." - Richard Feynman [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c&t=24m2s)

Microscopes are a fantastic tool for exploring the beauty of living systems.  
In week-1's reading, you encountered Van Leeuwenhoek's simple yet powerful microscope.  Since Van Leeuwenhoek's time, building microscopes - that enable us to observe living matter across various scales - have been an ongoing and exciting area research. Microscopes are routinely used by bioengineers to test, quantify, and visualize their engineered systems. 
For example, you, as part of BIOE.44 (Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab), could build a genetic circuit in *E. coli* that produces green fluorescent proteins in response to environmental toxins such as lead or arsenic. Or you can build a genetic clock (oscillator) that expresses fluorescent proteins at predefined time frequencies. For both examples, you could use a fluorescent microscope to see, quantify, and test the operation of your engineered organisms.  

*Optional reading:

Nobel prize in chemistry 2017, for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determinationof biomolecules in solution [They captured life in atomic detail](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/popular-chemistryprize2017.pdf), and [Scientifc Background ](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf)*

Despite the tremendous progress in microscopy, modern microscopes (for the most part) are expensive lab instruments that cannot easily be used or shared outside of labs. 

**Q.1. But what if you do not have access to a lab with a microscope?  
(Wouldn't it be nice to take your microscope with you wherever you go to explore the living matter?**  

**Q.2. How can we as engineers enable all learners, explorers, and makers to have access to tools such as microscopes?**


### Self-Assessment - Maker or Explorer

Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device (a box) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. Do you exclaim (choose one):

          DARN!!! 	COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? Remember your answer.
