## Preclass for Monday

### Activity â€“ Tools for seeing biology (Foldscope)

"If you want to know how nature works, (you) looked at it, carefully. Looking at it, that's the way it looks.  You don't like it? Go somewhere else, to another universe where the rules are simpler..."

- Richard Feynman [source]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c&t=24m2s')

Microscopes are an essential tool in our ability to learn about living systems.  In week-1's reading, you encountered  Van Leeuwenhoek's simple yet powerful microscope.  Building microscopes that enable us to observe biological systems across various scales have been an ongoing and exciting area of scientific and engineering research.  


### Self-Assessment - Maker or Explorer

Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device (a box) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. Do you exclaim (choose one):

          DARN!!! 	COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? Remember your answer.
