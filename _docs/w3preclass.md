## Preclass for Monday
Please read and consider the below before start of class on Monday.
The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.


### Introduction |Technology, Tools, and Trends (DNA read and write)

This week we will explore **What changes may arise via trends in DNA read andwrite tools may matter for the rest of our lives?**  We hope you will learn more about the core capacities for accessing and encoding DNA and also consider thequantitative pacing of how these tools are improving.  This pre-class materialfocuses mostly on DNA sequencing...

**Goal 1:** You should be able to describe how DNA sequencing works.

**Goal 2:** You should be able to describe the pace of developments in DNAread and write and be ready to discuss the ramifications of thisdevelopment.

Let’s begin!

## Example 1: Non-invasive prenatal testing

Put yourself in the shoes of a couple who recently discovered they were pregnant, andare worried about genetic disorders in their unborn child (e.g., Down syndrome).

**Scenario-1:** It is 2010 and the standard of care is amniocentesis, an invasive procedurein which a large needle is used to directly sample fluid from the amniotic sac [optional link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXIW8GHwJ_M)

**Q.1.** What do you think about the test, would you take it? Why?

**Scenario-2:** It is 2018 and in leading-edge children’s hospitals amniocentesis has beenreplaced by non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), previously known as cell free DNA testing. NIPT is based on a simple blood draw that enables determination of geneticdisorders and even the sex of an unborn fetus. The test works because it turns out thatthere is DNA from the fetus circulating in the pregnant woman’s blood (e.g., if apregnant woman has Y chromosome DNA in her blood then she is carrying a malefetus). Please watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e86_l_UqecU)about cell free fetal DNA analysis if you want moredetail.

**Q.3.** Do you think NIPT could have been economically feasible in the year 2010?What about 2000, or 1990? Why?

**Q.4.** What factors do you think led to exponential cost reduction in DNAsequencing?
