The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.


### Introduction |Technology, Tools, and Trends (DNA read and write)

This week we will explore **What changes may arise via trends in DNA read andwrite tools may matter for the rest of our lives?**  We hope you will learn more about the core capacities for accessing and encoding DNA and also consider thequantitative pacing of how these tools are improving.  This pre-class materialfocuses mostly on DNA sequencing...

**Goal 1:** You should be able to describe how DNA sequencing works.

**Goal 2:** You should be able to describe the pace of developments in DNAread and write and be ready to discuss the ramifications of thisdevelopment.

Let’s begin!

## Example 1: Non-invasive prenatal testing

Put yourself in the shoes of a couple who recently discovered they were pregnant, andare worried about genetic disorders in their unborn child (e.g., Down syndrome).

**Scenario-1:** It is 2010 and the standard of care is amniocentesis, an invasive procedurein which a large needle is used to directly sample fluid from the amniotic sac [optional link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXIW8GHwJ_M)

**Q.1.** What do you think about the test, would you take it? Why?

**Scenario-2:** It is 2018 and in leading-edge children’s hospitals amniocentesis has beenreplaced by non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), previously known as cell free DNA testing. NIPT is based on a simple blood draw that enables determination of geneticdisorders and even the sex of an unborn fetus. The test works because it turns out thatthere is DNA from the fetus circulating in the pregnant woman’s blood (e.g., if apregnant woman has Y chromosome DNA in her blood then she is carrying a malefetus). Please watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e86_l_UqecU) about cell free fetal DNA analysis if you want moredetail.

**Q.3.** Do you think NIPT could have been economically feasible in the year 2010?What about 2000, or 1990? Why?

**Q.4.** What factors do you think led to exponential cost reduction in DNA sequencing?

## Example 2: DNA literacy (DNA read)

DNA is made up of nucleotides. These nucleotideshave four possible bases; adenine (A), thymine (T),guanine (G), and cytosine (C).All DNA is made up of sequences of these four bases.Imagine a four key typewriter that is able to type the DNA codes for all of the biodiversity seen on earth. Being able to both **read DNA** (sequencing) and **writeDNA** (synthesizing) has and will continue to givebioengineers the ability to design and build with livingmatter in ways that were hard to imagine very recently.
Let’s delve into how current sequencing technologies work.

Start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuYATh7Y74) that provides backgroundabout sequencing and its use to decode the human genome, with a focus on “massivelyparallel sequencing” (often marketed as “next-generation” sequencing technology). Figure-2, also breaks down the same process described in the video.

**Figure.2.** goes here

During sequencing first, the genomic DNA (the DNA that we want to read) is broken intosmaller pieces (fragmented). Then a synthetic linker sequence is added to the end ofthe fragments (adaptor) which helps the DNA fragments get attached to a surface onwhich the sequencing happens (flow cell). Next, the DNA fragments are separated inspace and read individually. Each fragment is amplified (thousands of copies of eachpiece is made) to make sure the correct sequence is detected. To actually read thefragments, pre-labeled nucleotides (nucleotides with color) and enzymes (thatincorporate nucleotides into the fragments) are added to the flow cell. As each coloredbase pair is added to the fragments a new colorful spot is introduced. By taking imagesfrom the spots we are able to decode the sequence. Finally, the fragments are stitchedtogether to reveal the original sequence of the genomic DNA. Here is an additionalvideo that describes this process in even more detail [optional link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8).

**Q.5.** According to the “How to sequence the human genome” video when was thefirst human genome sequenced? How long did it take? How much did it cost?

**Q.6.** How much would it cost if you were to sequence the human genome in 2018?

**Q.7.** Thinking back to the design, build, and test (DBT) class. What are theconsequences of lowering sequencing cost (both money and time)?
