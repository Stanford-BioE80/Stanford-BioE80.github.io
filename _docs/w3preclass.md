## Analysis & Design of Molecules & Genetic Systems
Please read and consider the below before the start of each class.
The questions are study-questions and not homework to be graded.
Talk about anything you find interesting with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like, using Piazza or email the instructors!

## Preclass for Monday

### Activity â€“ Tools for seeing biology (Foldscope)

"If you want to know how nature works, (you) looked at it, carefully. Looking at it, that's the way it looks.  You don't like it? Go somewhere else, to another universe where the rules are simpler..."

- Richard Feynman [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c&t=24m2s)

Microscopes are an essential tool for exploring the beauty of living systems.  In week-1's reading, you encountered        Van Leeuwenhoek's simple yet powerful microscope.  Since Van Leeuwenhoek's time, building microscopes - that enable us to observe living matter across various scales - have been an ongoing and exciting area research . Microscopes also enable us to monitor and visualize bioengineered systems. For example, you may build a genetic circuit in *E. coli* that produces green fluorescent proteins (that can be visulized and quantified by a microscope)  when it detects environmental toxins such as lead or arsenic. See BIOE 44: Fundamentals for Engineering Biology Lab.

*Optional reading:

### Self-Assessment - Maker or Explorer

Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device (a box) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. Do you exclaim (choose one):

          DARN!!! 	COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? Remember your answer.
