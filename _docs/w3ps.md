# Problem Set Week-3

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.

**NOTE:** Please make sure to not go over the word limits.


**Goals:** Welcome to PSET-3.


 ## (Q1) Buggy Bacterial Flash Mob? (40 pts)
 
 Students at MIT are claiming that they have designed a genetic program to realize 
 arepeating bacterial flash mob.  See their work yet again via:
 
 https://2006.igem.org/wiki/index.php/IAP2004:Polkadorks
 
In an epic East Coast versus West Coast technology “battle,” some of your colleagues
are now claiming that the genetic program designed at MIT won’t actually produce the
so-desired behavior.  Looking only at their proposed “device-level system diagram”...


1.a. What do you think?  Will their program work or not?   (20 points)


YES or NO (circle one)


1.b. Why or why not? (bullet points) (20 points)


## (Q2) Bacterial edge detection (40 pts)


Building on work first published in 2005, Jeff Tabor and colleagues eventually demonstrated a 
bacterial edge detection system.  In their system a bacterial lawn (i.e., a uniform layer of identically engineered 
bacteria growing on a plate) detect a light-encoded image.  The bacteria are initially all the same but, 
depending on whether they are exposed to light or not, send or receive small molecule-encoded signals that diffuse 
across the light/dark boundary.  Only cells positioned at the boundary between light and dark express an enzyme that 
results in formation of a dark pigment (HINT: see Figure and also the primary 
[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775486/))


Add figure here. 

2.a. **Develop a device-level block diagram** that would result in the so-shown behavior.Label simple sensors, logic blocks, and actuators, as needed.  Connect outputs to inputsif and as required. (Hint:  Only give simple device names (e.g., “Dark sensor,” “pigmentactuator” etc.); do not describe any biology in any molecular detail).  (30 points)


2.b. Take a look at the photo of the system in action. Note the edge detection in the case of asquare or Alfred Hitchcock’s portrait. **What do you observe?** For example, why is there more pigment inside the corners of the square, or inside the bottom left angle of Alfred’s portrait?  (bullet points, 10 points)


## (Q3) Ring Oscillator (20 pts)


Here is a system level diagram of a 3-inverter Ring oscillator. Think back to the class on Wednesday, imagine that you are a system's level **Bioengineer** designing this oscillator...

Add figure here. 


3.a. What is an ideal inverter from a systems level perspective? (bullet points and a simple diagram to describe inputs and outputs for the inverters) (10 points)


3.b. Provide an example of a bad design choice, from system's level view, for these inverters? (Ring oscillator should still work) (10 points)


**Extra learning** (100% optional):

If you want to explore more re: a different type of DNA logic mentioned briefly in class, pleasecheck out this video from Prof. Endy on how to to engineer Boolean integrase Logic (BIL) gatesbased on DNA flipping...
