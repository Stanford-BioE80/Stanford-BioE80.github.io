## (Q1) Revisiting Design Tools (PyMol) (20 pts)

In this problem, you will use PyMol to visualize green fluorescent protein (GFP).
GFP is a 238 amino acid protein. For more information about GFP, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein), or see the resources below.

Check out the website where the GFP structure is housed: [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl). Notice that we are looking at a homo-dimer, meaning that 2 identical 238 amino acid chains are in the structure. 

Note:  Please include figure labels when sharing figures. 

**Q.1.a.** What is the experimental method used to get the structure of the protein? What is the listed resolution of the structure? (bullet points)

**Q.1.b.** Add a screenshot of your GFP structure in PyMol showing the "beta barrel" structure of fluorescent proteins. 

To do so:

1. Download PyMol from this [Pymol Link]( https://pymol.org/2/) and open PyMol on your laptop or computer. 

2. Type in the command “fetch 1gfl” in PyMol. This command downloads the structure of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)

3. In PyMol and take a look at the GFP structure.  Under the menus “H” and “S”  listed near the structure name on the toolbar on the right, click `Hide everything` and `Show cartoon`. 

4. **Take a screenshot of the protein structure to share as part of the problem set**

*Extra activity-1*

5. Click on <Mouse → 1 button viewing> to enable scrolling.

6. Click on <Display → Sequence On> to see the amino acid sequence for GFP.

7. Select residues 64-66 SYG and color these residues red. This is the **chromophore** of GFP, the portion of the molecule responsible for the fluorescence.

8. Render the SYG portion of the protein as ‘sticks’. You should now be able to see the (cyclized) ring of the GFP chromophore. Take a second screenshot of the protein with chromophore highlighted. 

**Q.1.c.**  Go back to the Protein Data Bank website and find a `.pdb` file for another fluorescent protein. Use PyMol to visualize this second protein. Provide a screenshot and tell us what color and wavelength the protein fluoresces.

*Extra and fun activity-2*
Would you [like](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/paper-models/green-fluorescent-protein-gfp) to build your own 3D GFP paper model?  Go to the following link and use the instruction and the template to build your own model. If you did make the model please share a photo with us.

## (Q2) Foldscope (40 pts)

**2020 Note:** Given the unique circumstance of this quarter and if you don't have access to your own foldscope you can use the photos available from [Microcosmos](https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/) For example, you can use an entry from last year’s BIOE80 class: [link](https://microcosmos.foldscope.com/?p=140485) to complete the questions. 

The following is an exercise carefully designed by Tom Knight to help you understand if you are more interested in science or engineering. There is no right answer and all types are welcome in the course! Rather, what you experience via the following can help you (and us) understand how you most like to work and learn. I.e., what follows is analogous to learning which foot you prefer to put forward on a skateboard, surfboard, or snowboard (right of left), or whether you prefer to throw with your right or left hand, etc.

### Self-Assessment: 

Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device (a box) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! 
Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. 

Do you exclaim (choose one):

          DARN!!! 	COOL!!!

**Q.2.a.** Why did you pick your choice? (1-2 sentences)

Relax again. Close your eyes and look inside yourself. Relax some more. 
Might you want to be an Explorer of the Unknown? Or, a Maker of New Things? 
Choose one path to follow for now. Focus on one path for now so that you can really push yourself in the context of this activity. Use your answer to Step 1 to think about your choice. 

If you picked DARN!!! please go to the **Maker** step. 

If you picked COOL!!! please go to the **Explorer** step.


**Q.2.b.Welcome Explorers!**

You have been granted the status, **biologically curious explorer of the microcosmic universe!** Your job is to explore objects, mysteries, and open questions that relate to the microscopic world. Equiped with your own microscope. 

Firstly, you have to ask a question in the realm of micro-cosmos, an original question. 
It does not matter if somebody has answered it 100 years ago or if science does not know 
how to begin to think about it. Choose a question that can be explored with microscale observations. Such as - how many cells thick is a leaf, how do hairs split, do insects also have blood cells, what does insect skin look like, what mold is growing in my fridge, what grows in a drop of pond water...You get the idea.  Now based on your emerging  question, collect samples and visulize them with your microscope. 

To complete this activity, prepare and submit the following entry (1 paragraph). 

Consider including responses to the following items below. (If you use a photo from microcosmos instead of your own photo make sure to refrence the source)

A. What question or what range of questions did you ask? 
B. What did you see / find as a result? 
C. A great image or data to support your findings and conclusions (Note for 2020, does not have to be your own)
D. Your concluding thoughts or open questions.


**Q.2.b.Welcome Makers!**
