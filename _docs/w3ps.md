## (Q1) Revisiting Design Tools (PyMol) (20 pts)

In this problem, you will use PyMol to visualize green fluorescent protein (GFP).
GFP is a 238 amino acid protein. For more information about GFP, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein), or see the resources below.

Check out the website where the GFP structure is housed: [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1gfl). Notice that we are looking at a homo-dimer, meaning that 2 identical 238 amino acid chains are in the structure. 

Note:  Please include figure labels when sharing figures. 

**Q.1.a.** What is the experimental method used to get the structure of the protein? What is the listed resolution of the structure? (bullet points)

**Q.1.b.** Add a screenshot of your GFP structure in PyMol showing the "beta barrel" structure of fluorescent proteins. 

To do so:

1. Download PyMol from this [Pymol Link]( https://pymol.org/2/) and open PyMol on your laptop or computer. 

2. Type in the command “fetch 1gfl” in PyMol. This command downloads the structure of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)

3. In PyMol and take a look at the GFP structure.  Under the menus “H” and “S”  listed near the structure name on the toolbar on the right, click `Hide everything` and `Show cartoon`. 

4. **Take a screenshot of the protein structure to share as part of the problem set**

*Extra activity-1*

5. Click on <Mouse → 1 button viewing> to enable scrolling.

6.Click on <Display → Sequence On> to see the amino acid sequence for GFP.

7. Select residues 64-66 SYG and color these residues red. This is the **chromophore** of GFP, the portion of the molecule responsible for the fluorescence.

8. Render the SYG portion of the protein as ‘sticks’. You should now be able to see the (cyclized) ring of the GFP chromophore. Take a second screenshot of the protein with chromophore highlighted. 

**Q.1.c.**  Go back to the Protein Data Bank website and find a `.pdb` file for another fluorescent protein. Use PyMol to visualize this second protein. Provide a screenshot and tell us what color and wavelength the protein fluoresces.

*Extra and fun activity-2*
Would you [like](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/paper-models/green-fluorescent-protein-gfp) to build your own 3D GFP paper model?  Go to the following link and use the instruction and the template to build your own model. If you did make the model please share a photo with us.
