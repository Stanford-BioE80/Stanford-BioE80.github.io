# Problem Set Week-3

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas 

**GOAL:** Welcome to PSET-3. This problem set will help you further develop your ability to
describe how DNA read/write work. Coupled with this you will examine the consequences of
non-trivial *quantitative pacing* in the development of these technologies. 
Finally, you will examine the consequence of  interconvertability of matter and information as DNA read/write
tools improve and discuss the *qualitative changes* that emerge.

## (Q1) Brainstorming Report (20 pts)

1.a. Drawing from your experiences in class Friday, and given ongoing developments in toolsthat impact and 
enable bioengineering, and combined with the fact that most of bioengineeringhasnâ€™t yet been imagined 
let alone realized... **What idea regarding a future potentialdevelopment in bioengineering do you most 
like and wish to make true?**

1.b. What else needs to be made true before your idea is or becomes realistic to pursue?
Stated differently, identify and briefly describe any key necessary knowledge or essential technical capacity 
that must exist before you would believe it practical to pursue your idea.

1.c. Given your response to 1.b, when do you believe would be the right time to start work onyour project?  
2018?  2020?  2025?  2050?  I.e., name the year you think you should getorganized and going on your project.
