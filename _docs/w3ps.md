# Problem Set Week-3

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas 

**GOAL:** Welcome to PSET-3. This problem set will help you further develop your ability to
describe how DNA read/write work. Coupled with this you will examine the consequences of
non-trivial *quantitative pacing* in the development of these technologies. 
Finally, you will examine the consequence of  interconvertability of matter and information as DNA read/write
tools improve and discuss the *qualitative changes* that emerge.

## (Q1) Brainstorming Report (20 pts)

1.a. Drawing from your experiences in class Friday, and given ongoing developments in toolsthat impact and 
enable bioengineering, and combined with the fact that most of bioengineeringhasn’t yet been imagined 
let alone realized... **What idea regarding a future potentialdevelopment in bioengineering do you most 
like and wish to make true?**

1.b. What else needs to be made true before your idea is or becomes realistic to pursue?
Stated differently, identify and briefly describe any key necessary knowledge or essential technical capacity 
that must exist before you would believe it practical to pursue your idea.

1.c. Given your response to 1.b, when do you believe would be the right time to start work onyour project?  
2018?  2020?  2025?  2050?  I.e., name the year you think you should getorganized and going on your project.

## (Q2) (Nature + Nurture) or (Fab a Family) (20 pts)

As we discussed briefly in class, over the past 12 years the price of synthesizing genes has dropped from $4 to $0.04 
per base pair; presume the future price of DNA synthesis will continueto drop two fold every two years. 
Meanwhile, Stanford’s undergraduate tuition is approximately $50,000 per year up from $25,000 in 2000.  
Presume Stanford’s tuition will continue to doubleevery 15 years.

2.a. If a human genome is 4 billion base pairs long then when will the cost of synthesizing theDNA encoding an entire human genome be roughly the same as the tuition cost associated with attending Stanford for one year? Hint: use the facts given, keep your math simple, and write itout. An approximate answer is fine. (Show your work)

2.b. What would be your estimate if the price of synthesizing genes continue to drop two foldevery 2.5 years instead of 2 years (i.e., only a 6-month longer doubling time). An approximateanswer is fine. 
What is the percent difference between your two estimations? 

2.c. Given your answer from part (a) presume that you could then design, build, and bring to lifea human encoded by a genome that you design (e.g., with any and all mutations that you andyour partner choose).  As potential parents would you prefer to spend your savings on collegetuition for a natural child or on realizing a genetically engineered offspring who then has to maketheir own way?

## (Q3) DNA as a Storage Medium (20 pts)

The US government has been using an underground salt mine in Pennsylvania as a long termstorage facility for physical documents, primarily retirement related papers. According to theWashington Post, in this facility approximately 1000 employees pass thousands of case filesfrom cavern to cavern and then type in retirees’ personal data, one line at a time. Basicdocument retrieval involves a forklift and takes days. Given the trends in DNA read and write,consider using DNA as an alternative storage medium for these documents.

Helpful numbers:
Volume of storage facility = 10 million m^3
Letters per cubic meter of typical government document = 10^9 letters/ m^3
Volume of a DNA base pair ~ 10^-27 m^3
Please round or simplify whenever convenient

3.a. Since DNA has only 4 bases, but English has 26 letters, you will somehow have to mapletters to bases. Briefly specify a simple encoding scheme for doing that. You *do not* have togive a letter to DNA mapping for all letters. 
The first few will do the trick. (4 pts)

3.b. Using your letter to DNA mapping, how many total base pairs of DNA would be needed tostore the archival contents of the salt mine; assume that the salt mine is completely packed withdocuments. (3 pts)

3.c. What would be the physical volume of this DNA? (2 pts)

3.d. Will the DNA fit into a thimble? (1 pt)        Yes        No

3.e. How expensive would it be to print this DNA (with cost ~1 cents/base) (2 pts)

3.f. Give two major advantages of using DNA as storage medium. (2 pts) (bullet points)

3.g. Give two major disadvantages of using DNA as storage medium. (2 pts) (bullet points)

3.h. How would you maintain and replicate (copy) this library (2 pts) (bullet points)

3.i. Can information be stored in the DNA in a living organism as opposed to DNA stored in afrozen tube (-80 freezer). 
If yes, what are one advantage and one disadvantage of using live cell storage? (2 pts)

## (Q4)Sequencing and Synthesis technologies (20 pts)

In the pre-class material you were introduced to a DNA read method commonly referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or massively parallelsequencing. Let’s examine an alternative approach, namely nanopore sequencing.

**figure. 1:Nanopore sequencing enables real-time read of the DNA.source : “DNA sequencing at 40: past, present and future”**

Watch this [video](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion)

4.a. Describe how Nanopore sequencing works (use bullet points). (8 pts)

MinION is a product that uses Nanopores for sequencing.
While the error rate with Nanopore technology is between 5-10%. [additional Link](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-760/v1). This tool can be used to sequence and assemble a human genome
[additional link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060).  Now brefiely examine the various products sequencing technology from illumina [link](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/comparison-tool.html).

4.b. How are NGS and Nanopore sequencing different? (4 pts)

4.c. Imagine that the storage of information in DNA from the previous question has become a routine platform. 
You have been hired as a consultant for a library that seeks to store its archiveinside the DNA medium. 
Your task is to determine suitable reading platforms. What type of“read technology” would you recommend: 
a sequencer that gives massive simultaneous shortreads with very low error, 
or fast readers that reads long sequences with error rates as high as 15 %. 
Please include quantitative reasoning in your answer.  (4 pts)

4.d. Where would you use an Illumina sequencing machine instead of a minION sequencingmachine? 
and vice versa? (4 pts)

### (EXTRA CREDIT) Scavenger hunt: Find some “artificial stone” and take a selfie (2 pts)

**Figure. 2: Example photo of George Goodman’s Artificial Stone(this photo is taken looking down at a sidewalk)**

Here is a sample photo of George Goodman’s artificial stone used to build parts of the campus.
As discussed This week standardization (process for dividing labor) in civil engineering has enabled us to transform and shape rocks (in this case artificial stones) into building blocks for building structures ranging from Stanford’s campus to Segovia’s aqueduct. 
You will receive 2 points extra credit if you find and take a selfie with any of Mr. Goodman’s Artificial Stones markers (there are many around the main quad). Please include a figure caption with your image.

**Final Notes:** This week you learned about tools and technologies that enable DNA read and write. As part ofyour core bioengineering skills you should be able to describe how these technologies work.You also learned about the non-trivial speed of development in these technologies and thevarious ramifications of this development. 

Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that youwould like to share with us?
