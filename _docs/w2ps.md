**NOTES:**

- Given the unique circumstance of Spring 2020, we ask you to do your best to maximize your learning. Each problem set is an opportunity to assess your learning, identify gaps, reflect on what you have learned, and determine what you wish to learn next.
- Problem sets must be completed individually unless stated otherwise.
- Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope. Please make sure to clearly indicate the starting and ending boundaries of your answers to each question on Gradescope.
- Please do not go over any word limits and where appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations with appropriate units).
