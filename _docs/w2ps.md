**PSET #2**

ASSIGNED: Friday 17 April 2020

DUE: 5:00p Pacific Friday 24 April 2020


**NOTES:**

- Given the unique circumstance of Spring 2020, we ask you to do your best to maximize your learning. Each problem set is an opportunity to assess your learning, identify gaps, reflect on what you have learned, and determine what you wish to learn next.
- Problem sets must be completed individually unless stated otherwise.
- Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope. Please make sure to clearly indicate the starting and ending boundaries of your answers to each question on Gradescope.
- Please do not go over any word limits and where appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations with appropriate units).


### (Q1) Artemisinin (20 points)

Think back to the case study: Production of Artemisinin via yeast

**Q.1.a.** List 3 major lessons from this case study? (3 bullet points)

Not:  For the following estimation questions please show your step by step calculations, keep track of units, and clearly state your assumptions. 

**Q.1.b.** The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that in 2017 there were 219 million cases of malaria [source](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria). If 3 grams of artemisinin are required per treatment of 1 individual, how many total grams of artemisinin are needed per year?

**Q.1.c.**  Sweet wormwood plants can produce 70 kg of artemisinin/ha land, where ha is a hectare of land.  Use your answer from Q.1.b. to estimate, how many total hectares of land would be needed to produce enough supply of artemisinin to treat all individuals suffering from malaria each year? 

**Q.1.d.**  Producing artemisinin via yeast can yield 25 g of artemisinin/liter. What volume of a reactor do you need to produce enough supply of artemisinin to treat all individuals suffering from malaria each year? Use your answer from Q.1.b.

**Q.1.e.**  Imagine that in the near future, you are the head of the WHO's Malaria Project.  In this future, land usage has become a challenge for the production of artemisinin given the need to grow food. You are presented with the following data: in order to feed the yeast reactor, you need to supply 1.6 kg sugar/liter (which yields 25 g artemisinin/liter). If you can produce 7500 kg sugar from 1 hectare, how many hectares of land would you need to produce enough artemisinin?

**Q.1.f.**  As the head of the WHO's Malaria Project, would you switch artemisinin production from wormwood to production via yeast?  If yes, please explain why. If not, what would you want to see before considering a switch?  

### (Q2) Fantastic Voyage (20 Points)

In the near future, you and your team are planning to remove an inoperable tumor from the brain of an important scientist. You conclude that the only way that the tumor can be destroyed is to remove it from the inside of the patient's own body. You imagine a submarine that can be shrunk and will carry the team of experts and doctors.            
Sadly, however, no shrink ray exists in this future [Fantastic Voyage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/)

Instead, you can begin to engineer living matter, microbes or patient's cells that are already small.
Briefly read the abstract of the paper titled [Acoustic reporter genes for noninvasive imaging of microorganisms in mammalian hosts](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25021), which enables imaging and control of living matter in mammalian hosts.

**Q.2.a.** In your own words summarize the abstract in 2-3 sentences. What is the main claim of this paper?

**Q.2.b.** According to the abstract what is the origin and purpose of the gas-filled protein nanostructures in nature?  

**Q.2.c.** What is a typical size of the gas-filled proteins?  How are the gas-filled proteins visualized in the paper (what technique)?  Can the gas-field proteins be visualized directly via a light microscope (yes/no)? Why? 

**Q.2.d.** Can you think about and describe another application (medical or other) for these engineered microbes (bullet points). 

**Q.2.e.** In your opinion, what are the paperâ€™s strengths and significance?  What are the paper's shortcomings and deficiencies? How can the paper improve?
