# Problem Set Week-8

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.

**NOTE:** Please make sure to not go over the word limits.

## (Q1)  Rousseau and Hobbes (15 Points)

1.a. How do Rousseau’s assumptions about human nature differ from Hobbes’? (Max 50 words, 5 points)
 
1.b. Do you think those practicing bioengineering should be licensed? Also, who gets to decide?
In the context of bioengineering, how the assumptions from part A could lead to differences regarding 
how people are organized, or organize themselves. 
Note: In this question, we are looking for a clear and logical argument that uses the assumptions from 1.a. 
(100 words, 10 points)

## (Q2) Insulin and Access (30 Points)

2.a. Examine these resources and briefly answer the following: What are theglobal trends of the disease? 
How affordable (and accessible) is insulin currently? (bullet points)

- WHO Diabetes: [resource-1](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes)


- Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group at 
Hearing of Senate Special Committee on Aging:[resource-2](http://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2018/insulin-affordability-white-paper-release.html)


- PDB 101 - Diabetes Mellitus timeline:[resource-3](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/global-health/diabetes-mellitus/about/timeline)

2.b. Examine the structure of insulin from [link](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/14How) is human insulin different from pig insulin? Examine the structure of designer insulins from [link-2](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/194) Pick either long-acting or fast-acting insulins. What changes to the protein made these designerproteins (e.g., long-acting or fast-acting) possible? (bullet points)

2.c. Examine the following resources: 

First, skim the article titled: “Why is There No Generic Insulin? Historical Origins of a Modern Problem.”[link] (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1411398)

Next, the link to an open source project for making insulin: [link](http://openinsulin.org/)


Is it ok for the DIY bioengineers to create their own insulin? Use the Rousseau and Hobbesdiscussion to argue for your position? (2 to 3 sentences)

## (Q3) Artemisinin (15 Points)

Think back to the in class case study on the production of the key ingredient for the treatment ofmalaria, Artemisinin (Additional information here: [source-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3240), [source-2](http://www.nature.com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/articles/nature12051)

3.a. What were some of the key lessons from this example? (2-3 bullet points)

3.b. Why was the project not successful?(bullet points)

3.c. If you were in charge of this project what would you have done differently?(2-3 sentences)


## (Q4) Artemisinin (15 Points)

4.a. Did you show up on Friday, make your mycelium material object? (Yes / No)

4.b. Describe in broad terms what processes unique to living matter are enabling building withmushrooms possible. 
What are the potential and limitations of making with mushrooms? (bullet points)

4.c. How is making with mushrooms similar to or different from other manufacturing processessuch as 3D printing? (bullet points)

4.d. Looking forward, how do we go from creating matter with an inert function (e.g., a chair) to creat matter with biological function (i.e., growing a finger or a heart)? What new considerations need to be made? 


**Extra Credit (5 points)**

There are several great spots on campus to explore and bioprospect in search of newmushrooms that could potentially be used for making materials. 

For this activity you can explore the variety of fungal diversity outside (even theengineering quad has fungi to discover!).

Find a mushroom on campus, take a photo of it, and note your location (GPS coordinates via your phone) and other characteristics such as the surrounding ecology.  Document your finding by including a paragraph description, your photo, and the location of your find in your PSET submission. 

Please don’t disturb or eat any mushrooms you find for this extra credit.
