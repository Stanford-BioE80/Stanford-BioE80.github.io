**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTES:**
- All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
- Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.
- Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations)
**Goals:** Welcome to PSET-8. In this PSET you will review the minimal genome paper as practiceto learn how to read research papers. You will also improve your quantitative intuition with anestimation problem, 
and finally revisit the meet your microbe activity.

## (Q1)  Dancing Droplets (40 pts)

On Friday you participated in the Dancing Droplets activity.  Use pictures, diagrams, or drawings as appropriate. 

1.a. If you have two different droplets why do they chase each other? What other behaviors have you observed?

1.b. Why does the sharpie marker create a physical barrier?

1.c. To what extent were you able to realize increasingly autonomous behavior?

1.d. How good do we have to become at implementing these different frames of reference in order to engineer living matter?

## (Q2) Spatial GOOP (40 pts)

2.a. Two DNA devices have been engineered for use in GOOP (Figure, below).  Device A expresses protein A in the absence of protein B.  Device B expresses protein B in the presence of protein A.  Device A can also make GFP.  Each device is placed in a distinct reservoir within a micro-scale fluidic channel. Fresh GOOP (i.e., cell-free extract) is supplied from one end of the channel.   Using various channel lengths experimenters are testing a genetic system made from the two devices.  By studying the diagram in Figure 1.B, describe the expected relationships and behavior of the system.  
(2-3 sentences max)

2.b. Fig. 1.C shows two spatial arrangements of the genetic system. In the top arrangement device A is 50 µm away from device B. In the lower arrangement device A is 150 µm away from device B. The time responses for each arrangement is measured by GFP production from device A as presented below.  Does “trace-1” come from the 50 µm or 150 µm arrangement? 
(2 points)

2.c. Explain your choice, use appropriate equation(s).

## (Q3) Diffusion, Diffusion constant, and Diffusion time (20 pts)

 In the class material you were introduced to diffusion both qualitatively and quantitatively.
 In this question you will use these concepts for simple estimations. First let's warm up:
 
 1.a. A diffusion coefficient is quantitatively described by the following equation.   
 Where D=kTB/6πνa is Boltzmann's constant (1.3807 x 10 ^-23 J/K), T is the temperature (K) of the   
 surrounding medium ,ν is viscosity of surrounding medium (NxS/m^2), “a” is a measure of length 
 (radius of a sphere approximating the molecule).  What are the units for a diffusion coefficient? (5 pts)
 
 
1.b. You learn that the diffusion coefficient for a protein (~30 kDa GFP) in water is about 100 µm^2/s.
The diffusion constant for the same protein is in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is only 30 µm^2/s.
Intuitively do these numbers make sense? (Yes or No) Why? (Bullet points)
Using these numbers estimate the viscosity of the cytoplasm relative to the viscosity of water? 
(10 pts) (HINT: solve for using the equation given above).

Next, let’s estimate the time it takes for a protein to diffuse spontaneously across different typesof cells 
(diffusion time τ). We’ll use the formula τ = R^2/6D, where R is the traverse distance.

1.c. Calculate the times it takes for the same protein (~30 kDa GFP) with a diffusion constant D=30 µm^2/s to diffuse across four different cell types: 

(i) *E.coli* with R≈1 μm, 
(ii)  Yeast cell with R≈10 μm, 
(iii) HeLa cell with R≈20 μm, and
(iv) A neuronal cell axon with R≈1 cm.
What does the the diffusion time for the axon suggests to you? (5 pts)

This question is from the [Cell Biology by the Numbers](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-time-scales-for-diffusion-in-cells/)

**Final Notes:**  you explored the intersection of physics and living matter. You explore ddiffusion, and how to use diffusion to engineer  both *temporary* and *permanent* pattern viacell states and functions. You further explored biased random walks and how cells move and find resources.

**Your questions**
Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

*Additional Resources*    

The following link takes you to a paper titled [Life at Low Reynolds Number](https://www2.gwu.edu/~phy21bio/Reading/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number.pdf) that examines physics at the scale of a bacteria.  The following link takes you to a digital copy of a great book titled [The Machinery of life](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11568895) which can help you with the concepts we have covered both this week and in previous weeks.

*The following links* are **explorables** that can help you explore and build an intuition aboutpatterns and pattern formation.  We hope that you take some time and examine them on your own:
