**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTES:**

- All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
- Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via via Gradescope.
- Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations and units)


## (Q1) Spatial GOOP (0 pts)

Two DNA devices have been engineered for use in GOOP (Figure, below).  Device A expresses protein A in the absence of protein B.  Device B expresses protein B in the presence of protein A.  Device A can also make GFP.  Each device is placed in a distinct reservoir within a micro-scale fluidic channel. Fresh GOOP (i.e., cell-free extract) is supplied from one end of the channel.   Using various channel lengths experimenters are testing a genetic system made from the two devices. 

**1.a.**  By studying the diagram in Figure 1.B, describe the expected relationships and behavior of the system.  
(2-3 sentences max)

**1.b.** Fig. 1.C shows two spatial arrangements of the genetic system. In the top arrangement device A is 50 µm away from device B. In the lower arrangement device A is 150 µm away from device B. The time responses for each arrangement is measured by GFP production from device A as presented below.  Does “trace-1” come from the 50 µm or 150 µm arrangement? 


**1.c.** Explain your choice, use appropriate equation(s). (Hint: think about diffusion)

## (Q2) Diffusion, Diffusion constant, and Diffusion time (30 pts)

 In the class you were introduced to diffusion both qualitatively.
 In this question you will additionally explore diffusion quantitativly. 
 
First let's warm up:
 
Diffusion coefficient is described by the following equation: D=kTB/6πνa
 
 - D is Boltzmann's constant (1.3807 x 10 ^-23 J/K), 
 - T is the temperature (K) of the surrounding medium ,
 - ν is viscosity of surrounding medium (NxS/m^2), 
 - “a” is a measure of length (radius of a sphere approximating the molecule).  
 
 **2.a.** Using above determine the units for diffusion coefficient? (show your work)
 
You learn that the diffusion coefficient for a protein (~30 kDa GFP) in water is about 100 µm^2/s.
The diffusion constant for the same protein is in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is only 30 µm^2/s.

**2.b.** Intuitively do these numbers make sense? (Yes or No) Why? (Bullet points)

Next, let’s estimate the time it takes for a protein to diffuse spontaneously across different types of cells 
(diffusion time τ). We will use the formula τ = R^2/6D, where R is the traverse distance.

**2.c.** Calculate the times it takes for the protein (~30 kDa GFP) with a diffusion constant D=30 µm^2/s to diffuse across four different cell types: 

(i) *E.coli* with R≈1 μm, 

(ii)  Yeast cell with R≈10 μm, 

(iii) HeLa cell with R≈20 μm, and

(iv) A neuronal cell axon with R≈1 cm.

**2.d.** What does the the diffusion time for the axon suggests to you? 

This question is from the [Cell Biology by the Numbers](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-are-the-time-scales-for-diffusion-in-cells/)

## (Q3) Bacterial Edge Detection (10)

We talked about engineered *E.coli* which detects lightearlier in the quarter.  Building on earlier [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04405) first published in 2005, Jeff Tabor and colleagues eventually demonstrated abacterial edge detection system. In their system a bacterial lawn (i.e., a uniform layer of identically engineered bacteria growing on a plate) detect a light-encoded image.  The bacteriaare initially all the same but, depending on whether they are exposed to light or not, send or receive small molecule-encoded signals that diffuse across the light/dark boundary. Only bacteria positioned at the boundary between light and dark express an enzyme that results in formationof a dark pigment (HINT: see Figure on next page and also the primary [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775486/) article).

Take a look at the photo of the system in action. Note the edge detection in the case of asquare or Alfred Hitchcock’s portrait.

**3.a.** What do you observe?  (1-2 sentences) For example, why is there more pigment inside the corners of the square, or inside the bottom left angle of Alfred’s portrait? 

(Note: If you study the paper you can see how the authors use the Reaction-Diffusion Model to quantitatively describe and verify the Bacterial edge detection system)

## (Q4)  Dancing Droplets (40 pts)

On Friday you participated in the Dancing Droplets activity.  Use pictures, diagrams, or drawings as appropriate. 

**4.a.** If you have two different droplets why do they chase each other? What other behaviors have you observed?

**4.b.** Why does the sharpie marker create a physical barrier and how do the droplets respond to it?

**4.c.** To what extent were you able to realize increasingly autonomous behavior? (Include photos from each challenge)

**4.d.** How good do we have to become at implementing these different frames of reference in order to engineer living matter?

**Final Notes:**  you explored the intersection of physics and living matter. You explore ddiffusion, and how to use diffusion to engineer  both *temporary* and *permanent* pattern viacell states and functions. You further explored biased random walks and how cells move and find resources.

**Your questions**
Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

*Additional Resources*    

The following link takes you to a paper titled [Life at Low Reynolds Number](https://www2.gwu.edu/~phy21bio/Reading/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number.pdf) that examines physics at the scale of a bacteria.  The following link takes you to a digital copy of a great book titled [The Machinery of life](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11568895) which can help you with the concepts we have covered both this week and in previous weeks.

*The following links* are **explorables** that can help you explore and build an intuition aboutpatterns and pattern formation.  We hope that you take some time and examine them on your own:
