**DUE:** Next Friday(), beginning of class via **Gradescope**. 

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted opetherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via **Gradescope**. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations, units, and figure captions). 

**GOALS:** Reflect on the utility of evolution both as an algorithm and as a service.

## (Q1) Microbial Resistance (20 points)

According to recent news reports, a patient with a multi-drug resistant bacterial infection was cured by injecting 
phage (i.e., bacterial viruses [The Bacteriophage Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI3tsmFsrOg)) directly into the bacterial cyst inside thepatient’s abdomen. The patient was ultimately cured. The treatment, however, was not easy...

“The learning curve was steep and unmarked. There were bouts of sepsis — a life-threatening omplication caused by massive infection. Despite improvement, (the) patient’s conditionremained precarious. Doctors discovered that the bacterium eventually developed resistance to the phage, what Schooley would characterize as “the recurring Darwinian dance,” but the team compensated by continually tweaking treatment with new phage strains — some that had derived from sewage — and antibiotics.” [source](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx)

**Q.1.a.** From the above text and thinking back to what you learned about evolution, what are the challenges associated with implementing Phage therapy? (bullet points)

**Q.1.b.**  You are the director of a new “Phage Therapy Institute”. Specify three general research directions you could pursue to make phage therapeutic approach easier, faster,or safer. (What tools and technologies you need, what questions  you have to address) (3-4 sentences)

## (Q2) Mutation Rate and Genome Replication (20 points)

Thanks to a long-term evolution experiment [source](http://myxo.css.msu.edu/) it is possible to estimate that *E. coli* has a mutation rate on the order of 10^-10 (mutations/bps)/replication [source](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&id=105813).

**Q.2.a.** Assume that *E. coli* has a genome size of 5×10^6 base-pairs (bps). What is the rate of mutation/replication for *E. coli*?

**Q.2.b.** Assume there are 10^10  cells in a 5 mL overnight culture of *E. coli* (i.e., 10^10 genomes are replicating during the final doubling).  Given the rate of mutatuion/replication (from 4.a), how many novel mutations do you expect inside the overnight culture?

**Q.2.c.** Given your answer from 2.b and the size of *E.coli*'s genome, is 5mL of the overnight culture sufficent to ensure that you have every single nonlethal base pair substitution in culture? (Yes/ No then explain your answer in 2-3 sentences)

Note: Question-2 is based on an entry form [*Cell Biology by the Numbers*](http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-mutation-rate-during-genome-replication/). Please attempt the question on your own first without looking at the website.   

**Your questions**
Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

## Extra learning (100% optional):

## (Q4) Evolution as a Service (0 points)

**Q.4.a.** Describe two challenges associated with using Directed Evolution as an engineering approach? (bullet points)

Imagine that you want to engineer the rate of evolution (increase or decrease) in an engineered living matter. 

**Q.4.b.** Briefly describe a utility for engineering the rate of evolution itself. 
Stated differently, Where and how you would use such an organism if you wanted to use evolution as a service? 
(2-3 sentences)


## (Q5) Cystic Fibrosis (0 points)

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. 

“Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts, and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.” [source-1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700). This thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal environment for chronic bacterial and fungal infections. As a result CF patients mayoften have sinus infections, bronchitis, or pneumonia [source-1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700). CF itself is caused by a mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position in the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 1500 other mutations can produce CF [source-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis)

**Q.5.a.** Phage therapy has been proposed and tested as a  potential solution for managing infections in cystic fibrosis. Thinking back to what you learned about evolution, what are the challenges associated with implementing this solution? (bullet points)

Imagine that we could forever remove the gene that causes *90% of cases* of CF by engineering the human genome.

**Q.5.b.** Who should get to decide if we would permanently delete the gene from the gene pool? If you could permanently remove the gene what would you choose? (2-3 sentences)  (In this open-ended question we are looking for your reasoning)
