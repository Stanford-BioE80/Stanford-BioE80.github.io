# Problem Set Week-5

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.

**NOTE:** Please make sure to not go over the word limits. Please show your work. 


**Goals:** Welcome to PSET-5. 
After this problem set you will be able to quantitatively estimateand describe what happens in diffusing systems 
(e.g., how long does it take for a protein tomove inside a cell).  
You will also be able to describe how simple rules can give rise to complexpatterns both in living matter 
and abiotic systems.

## (Q1) Diffusion, Diffusion constant, and Diffusion time (20 pts)

 In the class material you were introduced to diffusion both qualitatively and quantitatively.
 In this PSET you will use these concepts for simple estimations. First let's warm up:
 
 1.a. A diffusion coefficient is quantitatively described by the following equation.   
 Where D=kTB/6πνa is Boltzmann's constant (1.3807 x 10 ^-23 J/K), T is the temperature (K) of the   
 surrounding medium ,ν is viscosity of surrounding medium (NxS/m^2), “a” is a measure of length 
 (radius of a sphere approximating the molecule).  What are the units for a diffusion coefficient? (5 pts)
 
 
1.b. You learn that the diffusion coefficient for a protein (~30 kDa GFP) in water is about 100 µm^2/s.
The diffusion constant for the same protein is in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is only 30 µm^2/s.
Intuitively do these numbers make sense? (Yes or No) Why? (Bullet points)
Using these numbers estimate the viscosity of the cytoplasm relative to the viscosity of water? 
(10 pts) (HINT: solve for using the equation given above).

Next, let’s estimate the time it takes for a protein to diffuse spontaneously across different typesof cells 
(diffusion time τ). We’ll use the formula τ = R^2/6D, where R is the traverse distance.

Add Figure-1 here. 


1.c. Calculate the times it takes for the same protein (~30 kDa GFP) with a diffusion constant D=30 µm^2/s to diffuse across four different cell types: 
              (i) *E.coli* with R≈1 μm, 
              (ii) Yeast cell withsμm2R​≈​10 μm, 
              (iii)  HeLa cell with R​≈​20 μm, 
              and (iv) a neuronal cell axon with R≈1 cm
