**DUE:** Next Friday, beginning of class.

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations)

## (Q1) Evolution as Service (30 points)

This week we explored evolution as service. 
Think back to the examples from the pre-classand in-class material.

1.a. Describe two challenges associated with using “directed evolution” as an engineering approach (bullet points)

1.b. Describe when is directed evolution a good engineering choice? 


## (Q2) Engineering the rate of evolution (20 points)

Imagine that you want to increase the rate of evolution in an engineered microbe...

2.a. Briefly describe a utility for engineering the rate of evolution in your selected organism. 
Stated differently, where and how you would use such an organism if you wanted to use evolution as a service? 
(bullet points)

2.b. Briefly describe a method or approach that you would use to increase the rate of evolution itself in your organism?
(bullet points)


## (Q3) Microbial Resistance (10 points)

According to recent news reports, a patient with a multi-drug resistant bacterial infection was cured by injecting 
phage (i.e., bacterial viruses) directly into the bacterial cyst inside thepatient’s abdomen. 
The patient was ultimately cured. The treatment, however, was not easy...

“The learning curve was steep and unmarked. There were bouts of sepsis — a life-threateningcomplication caused by massive infection. Despite improvement, (the) patient’s conditionremained precarious. Doctors discovered that the bacterium eventually developed resistance tothe phage, what Schooley would characterize as “the recurring Darwinian dance,” but the teamcompensated by continually tweaking treatment with new phage strains — some that hadderived from sewage — and antibiotics.” [source](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx)

3.a. You are the director of a new “Phage Therapy Institute”. Specify three generalresearch directions you could pursue to make phage therapeutic approach easier, faster,or safer. (5 points)

3.b.Select your favorite approach, in 100 words, write an argument in support of this approach (What tools and technologies you need) (5 points)


## (Q4) Cystic Fibrosis (10 points)

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestivesystem and other organs in the body. “Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus,sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in peoplewith cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Insteadof acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in thelungs and pancreas.” [source-1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700) This thick mucus in the lungsand sinuses provides an ideal environment for chronicbacterial and fungal infections. As a result CF patients mayoften have sinus infections, bronchitis, or pneumonia [source-1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353700). CF itself is caused by a mutation in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotidesthat results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position in the protein. This mutation accounts fortwo-thirds (66–70) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of casesin the United States; however, over 1500 other mutations canproduce CF [source-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis)

4.a. Phage therapy has  been proposed and tested as a  potential solution for managinginfections in cystic fibrosis. Thinking back to what you learned about evolution, what arethe challenges associated with implementing this solution? (bullet points)

4.b. Imagine that you could forever remove the gene that causes *90% of cases* of CF byengineering the human genome. Would you permanently delete the gene from the genepool? Why or why not? (50-100 words) (In this open-ended question we are looking foryour reasoning and not an exact solution)


## (Q5) Meet your Microbe (30 pts)

On Wednesday and Friday of this week you cultivated, grew, and examined the microbes from your skin.

3.a. Describe in your own words what is the microbiome, and provide a current example ofstudy of the microbiome (include references if needed) (Max 100 words)

3.b. What are key methods used to study the microbiome? (Bullet points)

3.c. What are the current and future roles of DNA sequencing and synthesis in thestudy and engineering of microbiome? (1 or 2 Bullet points for each)

3.d. **Colony Morphology** Examine the morphology of the colonies on your plates. Describe as comprehensively as possible the ONE most interesting colony at your table (you decide what’s interesting!). What is the size, shape, and shape of the colony? What is thenarrowest classification you can make of this colony? Make sure to include a picture. (Max 100 words)
