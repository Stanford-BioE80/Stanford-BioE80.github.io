# Problem Set Week-5

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.

**NOTE:** Please make sure to not go over the word limits. Please show your work. 


**Goals:** Welcome to PSET-5. 
After this problem set you will be able to quantitatively estimateand describe what happens in diffusing systems 
(e.g., how long does it take for a protein tomove inside a cell).  
You will also be able to describe how simple rules can give rise to complexpatterns both in living matter 
and abiotic systems.

## (Q1) Diffusion, Diffusion constant, and Diffusion time (20 pts)

 In the class material you were introduced to diffusion both qualitatively and quantitatively.
 In this PSET you will use these concepts for simple estimations. First let's warm up:
 
 1.a. A diffusion coefficient is quantitatively described by the following equation.   
 Where D=kTB/6πνa is Boltzmann's constant (1.3807 x 10 ^-23 J/K), T is the temperature (K) of the   
 surrounding medium ,ν is viscosity of surrounding medium (NxS/m^2), “a” is a measure of length 
 (radius of a sphere approximating the molecule).  What are the units for a diffusion coefficient? (5 pts)
