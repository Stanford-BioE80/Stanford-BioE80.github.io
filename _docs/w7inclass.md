## Friday In Class Gene Drives Activity

Dear ENGR/BIOE.80ers,

In class today you will confront the puzzle of malaria and decide whether (or not) bioengineers should intervene in an ongoing evolutionary process. 

By the end of class today you should have developed draft answers to the following three questions:

1. Who should decide whether to release engineered mosquitoes in Mombasa?

2. If *you* were responsible for the decision what would you decide?

3a. If you decided NO then why not?
3b. If you decided YES then via what release option? (see “Release Options” primer)

Files  will be shared in class. 
(To get started please access the files available here, in order:)
