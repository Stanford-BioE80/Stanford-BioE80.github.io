**DUE:** Next Friday (May 24) beginning of class.

**NOTES:**
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope.
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations) and include units.

## (Q1)  Rousseau and Hobbes (30 Points)

**Q.1.a.** How do Rousseau’s assumptions about human nature differ from Hobbes’? (2 bullet points)
 
**Q.1.b.** Do you think those practicing bioengineering should be licensed? Also, who gets to decide?
In the context of bioengineering, how the assumptions from part A could lead to differences regarding 
how people are organized, or organize themselves. 
Note: In this question, we are looking for a clear and logical argument that uses the assumptions from 1.a. 
(3-4 Sentences )

## (Q2) Insulin and Access (30 Points)

**Q.2.a.**  Examine these resources and briefly answer the following: 

What are the global trends of diabetes? 
How affordable (and accessible) is insulin currently? (3 bullet points)

- WHO Diabetes: [resource-1](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes)

- Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group at 
Hearing of Senate Special Committee on Aging: [resource-2](http://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2018/insulin-affordability-white-paper-release.html)

- PDB 101 - Diabetes Mellitus timeline: [resource-3](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/global-health/diabetes-mellitus/about/timeline)

**Q.2.b.**   Examine the structure of insulin from [link](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/14How) is human insulin different from pig insulin? 

**Q.2.c.** Examine the structure of designer insulins from [link-2](http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/194) Pick either long-acting or fast-acting insulins. What changes to the protein made these designer proteins (e.g., long-acting or fast-acting) possible? (bullet points)

**Q.2.d.** Examine the following resources: 

First, skim the article titled: “Why is There No Generic Insulin? Historical Origins of a Modern Problem.” [link](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1411398)

Next, the link to an open source project for making insulin: [link](http://openinsulin.org/)

Is it ok for the DIY bioengineers to create their own insulin? Use the Rousseau and Hobbes discussion to argue for your position? (3-4 sentences)

## (Q3) Cultural Flourishing (40 Points)

Select one of the four cases that were presented in class on Friday.

**Q.3.a.** Which case did you select?

**Q.3.b.** For your case, what you wish to happen or develop over time.  What is your desired outcome? 

**Q.3.c.** Which cultural concepts might apply or be relevant to your case?

**Q.3.d.**  Which skills may be usefull in navigating or advancing the situation presented to your desired outcome?

**Q.3.e.**  Put all of the above together into a draft plan (into a paragraph) for causing the future you wish for to come true or at least be more likely to come true?

**Your questions or concerns** Do you have any unanswered questions or concerns (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?
