## (Q1) Evolution as Service (30 points)

This week we explored evolution as service. 
Think back to the examples from the pre-classand in-class material.

1.a. Describe two challenges associated with using “directed evolution” as an engineering approach (bullet points)

1.b. Describe when is directed evolution a good engineering choice? 


## (Q2) Engineering the rate of evolution (20 points)

Imagine that you want to increase the rate of evolution in an engineered microbe...

2.a. Briefly describe a utility for engineering the rate of evolution in your selected organism. 
Stated differently, where and how you would use such an organism if you wanted to use evolution as a service? 
(bullet points)

2.b. Briefly describe a method or approach that you would use to increase the rate of evolution itself in your organism?
(bullet points)
