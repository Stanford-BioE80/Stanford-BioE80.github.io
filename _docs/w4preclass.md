## Preclass for Monday (This has to move)
Dear ENGR/BIOE.80ers,

Here are four study guide questions that you may find useful in reviewing your
knowledge of the pre-class material for tomorrow:

**Q.1.  What sorts of activities did the USAâ€™s biological weapons program include throughout the 20th century?**
  (see text starting on bottom of page 51).

**Q.2.  What was the underlying logic used during the Nixon administration to stand down the US bioweapons program?**  
(see text starting on bottom of page 53).

**Q.3.  Did the USSR halt its bioweapons program?  Why or why not?**
(see text starting on bottom of page 54).

**Q.4.  What does Matt Meselson conclude?  Are bioengineering-enabled bioweapons inevitable or not?**

Be great!  Team 80
