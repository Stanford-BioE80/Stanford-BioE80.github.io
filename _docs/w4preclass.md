# Week 4 Preclass

## Preclass for Monday

Your task is the read *"Design and synthesis of a minimalbacterial genome"* 
 [link](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/aad6253)
and answer the following five questions. 

There is no magic here and with a little bit of thought and Googling, you will be to make sense of the advance.  
Note that the pdf file contains two papers; one of them is a high-level summary and the longer paper is 
the actual research paper.  You do not need to understand everything– feel free to skim over many details – our goal here is high-level synthesis.  
That said –if you are curious to understand how things were actually done, go for it – everything in the paper 
should be accessible to you with some time and Googling.No-one is going to look at your answers below – they are for you – 
but they will be useful for the in-class session on Monday. 

**Q.1. Using your own words, describe what the authors did?**

**Q.2. What was the most surprising thing that the scientists discovered or learned?**

**Q.3. What  were  the  major  technology and engineering  barriers,  that  made  this  sort  of  thing  
impossible  until very recently? Give two or three examples.**

**Q.4. Give two simple DBT rules the team discovered.**

**Q.5. Thinking ahead, what do you think the authors and J. Craig Venter will do next – what they might be 
working on right now, given that he announced JCVI3.0 to the world back in 2016?**

### Meet Your Microbes!

After finishing this activity:
**Goal-1:** You will have been introduced to basic methods for cultivating andcategorizing microbial life in the lab; 
it turns out we can only cultivate ~1% of microbes found in nature in the lab 
(i.e., we can’t grow most microbes underlaboratory conditions, at least not yet).
