# Week 4 Preclass

## Preclass for Monday

Your task is the read *"Design and synthesis of a minimalbacterial genome"* 
 [link](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/aad6253) and answer the following five questions. 

There is no magic here and with a little bit of thought and Googling, you will be to make sense of the advance.  
Note that the pdf file contains two papers; one of them is a high-level summary and the longer paper is 
the actual research paper.  
You do not need to understand everything– feel free to skim over many details – our goal here is high-level synthesis.  
That said –if you are curious to understand how things were actually done, go for it – everything in the paper 
should be accessible to you with some time and Googling. 
No-one is going to look at your answers below – they are for you – but they will be useful for the in-class session on Monday. 

**Q.1. Using your own words, describe what the authors did?**

**Q.2. What was the most surprising thing that the scientists discovered or learned?**

**Q.3. What  were  the  major  technology and engineering  barriers,  that  made  this  sort  of  thing  
impossible  until very recently? Give two or three examples.**

**Q.4. Give two simple DBT rules the team discovered.**

**Q.5. Thinking ahead, what do you think the authors and J. Craig Venter will do next – what they might be 
working on right now, given that he announced JCVI3.0 to the world back in 2016?**

## Preclass Reading for Fridy 

### Meet Your Microbes!

After finishing this activity:

**Goal-1:** You will have been introduced to basic methods for cultivating andcategorizing 
microbial life in the lab; it turns out we can only cultivate ~1% of microbes found in nature in the lab 
(i.e., we can’t grow most microbes underlaboratory conditions, at least not yet).

**Goal-2:** You have been introduced to the diversity of the life (microbiome) that
live in and on you (are you?). And, begin to describe the role that the microbiome plays in your health and well being.

**Goal-3:** By observing this diversity of microbial phenotypes you will have theopportunity to appreciate the rich diversity and engineering potential that livingmatter provides.

In an earlier activity we used a Foldscope to observe and explore the world around us,either as explorers or makers looking for parts and inspiration. In today’s activity we willexplore the *microbiome* that lives on and within us.
The microbiome is the vast collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes thatshare our bodies (additional [link](https://www.nature.com/collections/stkpgwjvvk/content/content). Depending on their context they can play a positive
or a negative role in our health and well being. For example, they can cause orinfluence non-communicable diseases. Engineering the microbiome is considered bysome respected academics to be part of the the future of medicine. For example,researchers at Cornell recently engineered a gut microbe to address aspects ofdiabetes (see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626737)).

**Q.1. What do you think are various methods that we can use to study themicrobiome (i.e., all bacteria in and on you)? How can we tell what microbes arepresent in the microbiome?**

Thinking back to observing via your Foldscope, looking at microbes is certainly onemethod to study microbes. 
Figure-2 (below) is a beautiful photograph of multiplebacteria and fungal colonies. You may notice the different colors, shapes, sizes, andstructures of these colonies. Some of the colonies have a smooth morphology whileothers have a more folded surface. You may begin to ask what are the advantages ofhaving a smooth, or folded, or a rough surface. You may also use this diversity of properties as a possible approach to discern various microorganisms from one another.However there is one important caveat to keep in mind, the diversity of microbial worldis incredible but we can only cultivate for study approximately 1% of the microbes thatlive on you. This is in part because many microbes are highly “social” and dwell in andamong communities of other microbes. We still have much to learn about the 1% we can cultivate, with plenty more to learn from the 99% we can’t yet grow.

**Q.2. If we cannot cultivate and grow many components of the microbiome inisolation in the lab, how can we tell what is present in each context? Whatcontemporary technologies have enabled the study and engineering of themicrobiome?**

Think about your own answer and then visit the following link to begin to answer the above question [Scientists Unveil New ‘Tree of Life’](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/science/scientists-unveil-new-tree-of-life.html)

While the plate assays (growing bacteria on defined media) and looking at growth andphenotypes, may seem simple. They have and continue to play an incredibly powerfulrole in the discovery and development of biology as well as in the pursuit ofbioengineering. For example, *Figure-3* demonstrates a creative and unique plateassay called MEGA-plate (“mega” since the plate is **2x4 feet!**) to demonstrate andstudy bacterial evolution. MEGA plate was used to study the evolution andemergence of antibiotic resistance over time in bacterial populations. Make sure to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=yybsSqcB7mE).

### What Next
During the class, you will use the plates that you prepared on Wednesday toexamine and classifying the microbes 
that grew on your plates. To prepare for this make sure to take a look at the first page of this
