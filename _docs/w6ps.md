# Problem Set Week-6

**DUE:** Next Friday start of class via Canvas.

**NOTE:** All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.

**NOTE:** Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas.

**NOTE:** Please make sure to not go over the word limits.


**Goals:** Welcome to PSET-6.


 ## (Q1) Buggy Bacterial Flash Mob? (40 pts)
 
 Students at MIT are claiming that they have designed a genetic program to realize 
 arepeating bacterial flash mob.  See their work yet again via:

In an epic East Coast versus West Coast technology “battle,” some of your colleagues
are now claiming that the genetic program designed at MIT won’t actually produce the
so-desired behavior.  Looking only at their proposed “device-level system diagram”...


1.a. What do you think?  Will their program work or not?   (20 points)


YES or NO (circle one)


1.b. Why or why not? (bullet points) (20 points)


## (Q2) Bacterial edge detection (40 pts)


Building on work first published in 2005, Jeff Tabor and colleagues eventually demonstrated a 
bacterial edge detection system.  In their system a bacterial lawn (i.e., a uniform layer of identically engineered 
bacteria growing on a plate) detect a light-encoded image.  The bacteria are initially all the same but, 
depending on whether they are exposed to light or not, send or receive small molecule-encoded signals that diffuse 
across the light/dark boundary.  Only cells positioned at the boundary between light and dark express an enzyme that 
results in formation of a dark pigment (HINT: see Figure and also the primary
