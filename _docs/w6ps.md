**DUE:** Next Friday (May 17) beginning of class.

**NOTES:**
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope.
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations).

**GOAL:** Welcome to PSET-6. This problem set will help you further develop your ability to
describe how DNA read and write work. Coupled with this you will examine the consequences of
non-trivial *quantitative pacing* in the development of these technologies. Finally, you will examine the consequence of  interconvertability of matter and information as DNA read and write tools improve and discuss the *qualitative changes* that emerge.


## (Q1) (Nature + Nurture) or (Fab a Family) (30 pts)

Over the past 12 years the price of synthesizing genes has dropped from $4 to $0.04
per base pair; presume the future price of DNA synthesis will continue to drop two fold every two years.

Meanwhile Stanford’s undergraduate tuition is approximately $50,000 per year up from $25,000 in 2000.  
Presume Stanford’s tuition will continue to double every 15 years.

**Q.1.a.** If a human genome is 4 billion base pairs long then when will the cost of synthesizing the DNA encoding an entire human genome be roughly the same as the tuition cost associated with attending Stanford for one year?

Hint: Use the facts given. Keep your math simple, and write out the equations (i.e., show your work).
An approximate answer is fine.

**Q.1.b.**  What would be your estimate if the price of synthesizing genes continue to drop two fold every 2.5 years instead of 2 years (i.e., only a 6-month longer doubling time). An approximate answer is fine.

**Q.1.c.** Given your answer from part (a) presume that you could then design, build, and bring to life a human encoded by a genome that you design (e.g., with any and all mutations that you and your partner choose).  As potential parents would you prefer to spend your savings on college tuition for a natural child or on realizing a genetically engineered offspring who then has to make  their own way? Why? (2-3 sentences)

## (Q2) DNA as a Storage Medium (30 pts)

The US government has been using an underground salt mine in Pennsylvania as a long term storage facility for physical documents, primarily retirement related papers. According to the Washington Post, in this facility approximately 1000 employees pass thousands of case files from cavern to cavern and then type in retirees’ personal data, one line at a time. Basic document retrieval involves a forklift and takes days. Given the trends in DNA read and write, consider using DNA as an alternative storage medium for these documents.

Helpful numbers:

Volume of storage facility = 10 million m^3

Letters per cubic meter of typical government document = 10^9 letters/ m^3

Volume of a DNA base pair ~ 10^-27 m^3

Please round or simplify whenever convenient. Please show your work and include units.

**2.a.** Since DNA has only 4 bases, but English has 26 letters, you will somehow have to map letters to bases. Briefly specify a simple encoding scheme for doing that. You *do not* have to give a letter to DNA mapping for all letters.
The first few will do the trick.

**2.b.** Using your letter to DNA mapping, how many total base pairs of DNA would be needed to store the archival contents of the salt mine. Assume that the salt mine is completely packed with documents.

**2.c.** What would be the physical volume of this DNA?

**2.d.** Will the DNA fit into a thimble?  Yes / No

**2.e.**  How expensive would it be to print this DNA (with cost ~1 cents/base)

**2.f.** Give two major advantages of using DNA as storage medium (bullet points)

**2.g.**  Give two major disadvantages of using DNA as storage medium (bullet points)

**2.h.** How would you maintain and copy (replicate) this library (bullet points)

**2.i.** Can information be stored in the DNA in a living organism as opposed to DNA stored in a frozen tube (-80 freezer).
If yes, what are one advantage and one disadvantage of using live cell storage? (2 bullet points)

## (Q3) Meet your Microbe (40 pts)

On Wednesday and Friday of this week, you cultivated, grew, and examined the microbes from your skin.

**3.a.** Describe in your own words what is microbiome and provide a current research article of the microbiome (include a references link)?  What is the key claim of your paper? (3-4 sentences)

**3.b.** Name 2 key methods used to study the microbiome? (Bullet points)

**Colony Morphology** Make sure to include a picture and figure caption

**3.c.** Examine the morphology of the colonies on a plate from your table (your plate or a neighbor's  plate).
Describe as comprehensively as possible the ONE most interesting colony at your table (you decide what’s interesting!).
What is the size, shape, and shape of the colony? What is the narrowest classification you can make of this colony?  (4-5 sentences)

### (EXTRA CREDIT) Scavenger hunt: Find some “artificial stone” and take a selfie (2 pts)

**Figure-1:Example photo of George Goodman’s Artificial Stone (this photo is taken looking down at a sidewalk)**

Here is a sample photo of George Goodman’s artificial stone used to build parts of the campus.
As discussed this week standardization (process for dividing labor) in civil engineering has enabled us to transform and shape rocks (in this case artificial stones) into building blocks for building structures ranging from Stanford’s campus to Segovia’s aqueduct.

You will receive 2 points extra credit if you find and take a selfie with any of Mr. Goodman’s Artificial Stones markers (there are many around the main quad). Please include a figure caption with your image.

**Final Notes:** This week you learned about tools and technologies that enable DNA read and write. As part of your core bioengineering skills you should be able to describe how these technologies work.You also learned about the non-trivial speed of development in these technologies and the various ramifications of this development.

Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?


## Extra learning (100% optional):

### (Q4)Sequencing and Synthesis technologies (0 pts)

In the pre-class material you were introduced to a DNA read method commonly referred to as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or massively parallel sequencing. Let’s examine an alternative approach, namely nanopore sequencing.


Watch this [video](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion)

**4.a.** Describe how Nanopore sequencing works (use bullet points, 8 pts)

MinION is a product that uses Nanopores for sequencing.
While the error rate with Nanopore technology is between 5-10%. [additional Link](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-760/v1). This tool can be used to sequence and assemble a human genome
[additional link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060).  Now briefly examine the various products sequencing technology from Illumina [link](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/comparison-tool.html).

**4.b.** How are NGS and Nanopore sequencing different?

**4.c.** Imagine that the storage of information in DNA from the previous question has become a routine platform.
You have been hired as a consultant for a library that seeks to store its archive inside the DNA medium.
Your task is to determine suitable reading platforms. What type of“read technology” would you recommend:
a sequencer that gives massive simultaneous short reads with very low error,
or fast readers that reads long sequences with error rates as high as 15 %.
Please include quantitative reasoning in your answer.  

**4.d.** Where would you use an Illumina sequencing machine instead of a minION sequencing machine?
and vice versa?
