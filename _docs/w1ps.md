**DUE:** Next Friday, beginning of class.

**NOTES:** 
  - All BIOE.80 problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Canvas. 
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations)
  

**GOAL:** To help you reflect on the implications of engineering living matter.  To help you prepare for the quarter by thinking about your goals for the class. Finally, to help get you started on your journey as an explorer or maker in bioengineering.

## (Q1) Let's hear about you (2 pts)

What is your major and year? Have you taken (or are currently taking) any other bioengineering classes? What were the last books that you read (list 1 or 2)? 

## (Q2) What do you hope for out of this class? (8 pts)

Why are you taking BIOE.80? Stated differently, what do you most want to gain by successfully completing BIOE.80 this quarter? (150 words or less) 

## (Q3) The impact of Bioengineering

After the first week of the class, a friend asks you about bioengineering. Your friend is specifically interested in the impact of bioengineering on humanity and civilization so far. You think back to the three examples provided in the class (e.g., polio vaccine) and decide to draw upon those in formulating your own example. 

3.a. Create your own brief example on the impact of bioengineering today. Keep your answer between 150-200 words and include up to 3 key references in support of your new example; references can be websites or any citable source. (40 pts)

3.b. Do you have any unanswered questions based on your own example from or from the examples given in class that remain unanswered? Share your most interesting or difficult question; just one question, please. (10 pts)

## (Q4) Foldscope Activity (30 pts)

4.a. Did you show up on Friday, build your Foldscope, and have a TA check it? (5 pts)

4.b. Complete and submit the foldscope post class question "Explorer or Maker" (Max 150 words). (25 pts)

### Explorer or Maker - Step 1

The following is an exercise carefully designed by Tom Knight to help you understand if you are more interested in science or engineering.  There is no right answer and all types are welcome in the course!  Rather, what you experience via the following can help you (and us) understand how you most like to work and learn.  I.e., what follows is analogous to learning which foot you prefer to put forward on a skateboard, surfboard, or snowboard (right of left), or whether you prefer to throw with your right or left hand, etc.

Relax… take a deep breath… imagine the following situation… You've spent hours assembling a box that, once finished, is supposed to turn on a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished box on your workshop table and press the button... BANG!  A loud POP and then smoke pours from the device while the bulb stays dark. At this very instant do you exclaim (choose one):

DARN!!! 		COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? 

### Explorer or Maker - Step 2

Relax again. Close your eyes and look inside yourself. Relax some more. Might you want to be an Explorer of the Unknown?  Or, a Maker of New Things? Choose one path to follow for now. Note: You must only focus on one path for now so that you can really push yourself in the context of this activity. Use your answer to Step 1 to think about your choice. 

### Explorer or Maker - Step 3

If you are an Explorer then please go to the Explorer Step

If you are a Maker then please go to the Maker Step

### Explore or Maker - Step 4.  Welcome Explorers!

You have been granted the status, "biologically curious explorer of the microcosmic universe!" Your job is to explore objects, mysteries, and open questions that relate to the microscopic world. Your spaceship is the powerful “Foldscope” a field microscope that  you built with your own hands.

Firstly, you have to ask a question in the realm of micro-cosmos, an original question. It does not matter if somebody has answered it 100 years ago or if science does not know how to begin to think about it. Choose a question that can be explored with microscale observations. Such as - how many cells thick is a leaf, how do hairs split, do insects also have blood cells, what does insect skin look like, what mold is growing in my fridge, what grows in a drop of pond water... You get the idea. Your goal is to go on a journey to find an answer by just looking as yourself, without any other aids.

Now based on your emerging  question, go out of your comfort zone and collect samples. These samples could give you the diversity of answers you might be looking for. 

To complete this activity, over the next few days prepare and submit an entry  following the detailed submission instructions provided Friday. Consider including responses to the four items below. **(Make sure to include photos with descriptions)**

A. What question did I ask? Or what range of questions? What did I see as a result?

B. What did I actually do?

C. A great image or data to support your findings and conclusions.

D. Your concluding thoughts or open questions.

Your entry should be in a form where an 8-10 year old anywhere in the world could study your findings & actually replicate your work.

### Explore or Maker - Step 5. Welcome Makers!

You have been granted the status, "biologically empowered tinkerer of the microcosmic universe!" Your job is to explore nature, searching for tiny objects that might be useful either as inspiration, or as bits and pieces that might be directly reused to make something. Your spaceship is the powerful “Foldscope” a field microscope that you built with your own hands.

Firstly, you have to learn to explore various realms of microcosmos. It does not matter if somebody has searched the same space 100 years ago or if engineers do not know how to begin to think about the tiny things you find.

Hunt the patterns, solutions, and objects that can be explored with microscale observations. Such as how do plants transport water, how do grasshoppers hop without barrel rolling, how does a spider make a web, where do leaves go… You get the idea.

Your goal is to go on a journey to find the answer yourself, without any other aids.

Now based on your explorations, go out of your comfort zone and collect samples. Lots and lots of samples that could give you the diversity of answers you might be looking for.

We will take a sample collection trip during class on Friday for people to learn how to ask questions related to outdoor environments.

To complete this activity, over the next few days prepare and submit

an entry following the detailed instructions provided on Friday.  Consider including responses to the four items below. **(Make sure to include photos with descriptions)**

1. What useful biological object or potential inspiration from nature did I find?

2. How did I actually find it ?

3. A great image or data to support your findings and conclusions.

4. Your concluding thoughts or open questions.

Your entry should be in a form where an 8-10 year old anywhere in the world could study your findings & actually replicate your work.

## (Q5) Making with Methane (10 points)

In class you've already learned about examples of making with biology via organisms that are powered directly by the sun (e.g., papaya) and also by sugar (e.g., yeast-based brewing of medicines).  But did you know that there are microbes that "eat" natural gas?  These organisms are called methanotrophs, and they grow directly on methane (CH4), which provides both the energy and matter (i.e., carbon atoms) that the organisms require to reproduce, etc.

The local biohacker club has started playing around with methanotrophs.  Two biotech enthusiasts, Deanna and Samantha, show up one day with a "Personal Maker" box. Their box connects to a house's natural gas supply. They claim you can program methanotrophs with synthetic DNA to do different things like make plastics for 3D printing or even food for people. They argue that their maker box will work like a Replicator from Star Trek. People will no longer need to go to the store for food.  Instead, everyone will grow whatever is needed from scratch using programmable methanotrophs powered by domestic natural gas arriving via pipes. 

You quickly look up online that the local utility can supply up to 200 cubic feet of natural gas to each house or apartment per day, which equates to ~3 kg of carbon atoms in the form of methane (CH4) and ~50,000 watt \* hours of energy delivered per day. You also look up that one human operates on 100 watts of energy or 2,400 watt \* hours total per day. Considering these numbers and using basic "back of the envelope" math do you believe Deanna and Samantha's methane-powered methanotroph Personal Maker box might actually be useful? Why or why not?

**Your questions** Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

**(Extra credit)** Submit a photo you have taken to the Foldscope community via [Microcosmos Foldscope](http://microcosmos.foldscope.com/) or [NSF Vizzies](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/index.jsp). If you provide proof of participation (to be turned in the same day with the pset - e.g. screenshot) [NSF Vizzies](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/index.jsp) you will receive 5 extra points.
