**DUE:** Next Friday (April.17th), beginning of class (1:30 pm).

**NOTES:** 
  - Given the unique circumstance of Spring 2020, we ask you to do your best to maximize your learning. These problem sets are an opportunity to assess your learning, identify gaps, reflect on what you have learned, and determine what you wish to learn next. 
  - Problem sets must be completed individually unless plainly noted otherwise.
  - Please turn in your completed problem sets as an electronic copy via Gradescope. Please indicate the boundaries of each question.  
  - Please make sure to not go over the word limits and when appropriate show your work (e.g., calculations with appropriate units).

**GOAL:** To help you reflect on the implications of engineering living matter. To help you prepare for the quarter by thinking about your goals for the class. Finally, to help get you started on your journey as an explorer or maker in bioengineering.

## (Q1) Three words to describe a Bioengineer (10 pts)

Imagine a Bioengineer. Sketch that person as best as you can, on a piece of paper or digitally. 
Share the sketch here.  Describe them with three words. Include your sketch and three words in your submission. 
At the end of the course, you’ll have a chance to pick three new words. 
 
## (Q2) Three words to describe a Bioengineer (20 pts)

After the first week of the class, a friend asks you about bioengineering. Your friend is specifically interested in the impact of bioengineering on humanity and civilization so far. 
Think back / review the three examples provided in the pre-class reading (e.g., polio vaccine).

2.a. Create your own brief example (similar to the 3 examples from the reading) on the impact of bioengineering today. 

Notes: Keep your answer to 1 paragraph. Include 2 to 3 key references in support of your new example (i.e., papers, reports, websites). Figures are optional.

2.b. Now think about the future. What future do you wish to realize?  What roles can bioengineering play in realizing this future?  How would you define “success”?  Do you have any questions on how to realize this future?  What trends, tools, policies, and technologies could help you realize this future? (Please keep your answer to 1 paragraph)

Notes: Keep your answer to 1 paragraph.

**Comments:** Our aim is to enable you to begin to identify, organize, and communicate the topics that you are excited about.  Last year, initial efforts from this question helped guide students in identifying their final project. 

## (Q3)  Approximate and rapid numerical estimates (30 pts)

Often, bioengineers encounter a new biological system for which they have no intuition. How can we build intuition such that we have a better understanding of what is physically possible in a new system? As an example, let’s say you wanted to ferment potatoes with wild yeast to make rubbing alcohol. How much alcohol could you make per potato? Or, let’s say you wanted to know how many *E. coli* cells fit on the head of a pin. These problems don’t seem important on their own, but the process of thinking about and answering them makes it easier to tackle the harder problems in Bioengineering.
Fermi problems are order-of-magnitude estimation problems that try to roughly answer such complicated questions. We do so by using a series of simpler estimations, often using physical principles that are either widely known or easy to guess. Before knowing how many cells can live on a pin, we first need to estimate the size of a single cell and the size of the head of a pin.

Fermi problems are tools invented by physicists to build quantitative intuition for new or unintuitive systems, which have then been adopted broadly in almost every field that needs quantitative intuition building. Bioengineers use Fermi problems to determine the feasibility of an idea or better understand a new system. Most of these estimates are rough: they are designed to give you a broad, order of magnitude intuition for the living matter. Thus keep in mind that the exactly correct number could be different. 

Note for each calculation: Share your answers to two significant figures and provide units where appropriate. Show your work. You should only need simple math and arithmetic; a couple of lines of work at most. 

*Escherichia coli* is well-studied bacteria considered to be representative of how bacterial systems work generally (i.e., a ‘model’ organism). *E. coli* is also easy to grow in the lab and divides rapidly (about 20 mins) . As a result, *E. coli* is frequently used in bioengineering.

3.a. First, estimate the volume of an *E. coli* cell by approximating the cell as a rectangular box 2 um x 1 um x 1 um.  Next, estimate the cell volume by approximating the cell as a spherocylinder, as shown in Figure 1.  How different are these two approximations?   Go to the following [page](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&id=100004&ver=20). How does your estimation compare with the measured values? 
(Optional practice: convert the volume to Liters instead of m^3)

<figure>
<a href="/assets/images/w1ps.png"><img src="/assets/images/w1ps.png"></a>
<figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>. *E. coli* is shaped like a rod, which we can approximate as a spherocylinder: a cylinder with hemispherical caps. (Of note, MG1655 is a strain derived from a lineage of E. coli variants that was originally isolated from a diphtheria patient at the Palo Alto hospital in 1922.)</figcaption>

**For the rest of this problem, use your first estimate using a rectangular approximation.**
 
3.b. The mean diameter of a typical protein protein (assume a sphere shape) is roughly 4 nm. What is the upper bound on how many proteins could fit inside an *E. coli* cell? 

3.c. The mean volume of a DNA base pair is 10^-27 m^3. What is the upper bound on how many DNA base pairs could fit inside an *E. coli* cell?

3.d. Take a look at the estimated/measured numbers of proteins and DNA in an E. coli cell from figure-6.a of the following [link](http://book.bionumbers.org/the-geography-of-the-cell/). What is the ratio of the upper bound numbers to the estimated numbers? (present your results in a table) Are you surprised by these (the upper bound vs actual) numbers? Why or why not?
 
“Cell Biology by the Numbers” is a useful resource for learning estimation problems in biology.  You can get a free copy of the draft version [here](http://book.bionumbers.org/). The authors have recently published an informative [SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by the numbers](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/57309/elife-57309-v3.pdf) as well.


## (Q4) What's Unique About Living Matter? (10 pts)

Revisit the [video](https://youtu.be/NpZ3PXTnxdw) describing the unique properties of living matter.  

4.a. According to the video, what makes living matter unique? (list 2 and explain each in 2-3 sentences) 

4.b. After watching the video, what did you find most surprising? (2-3 sentences) 

## (Q5) Reading research papers (30 pts)

Research papers serve as a primary source of information for many fields. One of the goals for BIOE/ENGR. 80 is to start to familiarize you with scientific literature. 

Briefly read the following paper or preprint: “Enabling community-based metrology for wood-degrading fungi” available from: [link](https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-020-00092-2)

5.a. In your own words, what is the primary claim of the paper? Take a look at the abstract (1-2 sentences)

5.b. In your own words, what are the primary evidence in support of the claim? Take a look at the figures)? (1-2 sentences)

5.c. What did you find the most interesting idea, fact, conclusion from the abstract of the paper? (From the abstract, figure, or conclusion)

**Your questions** Do you have any unanswered questions (from this week, past weeks, or general BIOE) that you would like to share with us?

## Additional Learning Resource: 

There are tools for helping you keep track of and manage your library of paper. For example here is a link to a  free and useful resource: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) 
The takeaway here is to make sure you have a system in place for managing your paper.

Biology refresher-1:  If you need additional learning materials or refresher for biology you can start by going through the first 3 chapters (It is very brief don't worry) of The Machinery of Life by David S. Goodsell.  An electronic copy of the book is available from Stanford Library and you should be able to access from [here](https://stanford.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-84925-6)
