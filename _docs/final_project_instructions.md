We will host your projects on the class website.

# Final Project Instructions

## Your wish, your plan, your play 

Your final project has three major parts.  They are your wish, your plan, and your play.  

The goal of the final group project is to empower you to think about and plan for a future you wish to realize.  We aim to enable you to devise and express your **wish** that can be implemented via bioengineering by 2030.  We will help you develop a practical\technical plan for realizing your wish.  Finally, we will ask you to represent these wishes and plans as a story  (specifically a 3-act zoom play).   

Independent of your academic level, whether a first-year or a graduating senior, we hope that the project will enable you to take steps towards organizing your plans.  As a first-year, the project may help you decide what other courses to take in the future.  As a graduating senior, the project may help you reflect on what you have learned and use them in realizing your next steps.  

## Rubric 
You will have to complete the following deliverables as part of the project.

#### Team rules --- 5 pts
#### Brainstorm and ideation --- 5 pts
#### Priority --- 10 pts
#### Written research and background document  --- 20 pts
	Questions to conside (Modified Heilmeier Catechism)
    What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
	  How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
	  What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
	  Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
    What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
	  What is the greatest obstacle?
	  What could go horribly wrong? What are the risks?
	  How much will it cost?  How long will it take?
#### High-level storyboard --- 20 pts 
#### Final Recording  --- 30 pts
	 Empathy for audience - 20 %
	 Clarity - 35 %
	 Science & technology - 35 %
	 Sizzle factor -10%
#### Team reviews --- 10 pts

There will be additional information and deadlines for each deliverable.
Briefly, your team’s final recording should be a 12-15 min zoom recording (play). 
Please turn in your final project **not later than 5p on Thursday 11 June.** 

You will NOT need to do a formal presentation or report in class.   

Please ask us if you have any questions.   

## GRADING

**Team Rules** -- you and your group decide your rules. 

**Brainstorming** -- your list of ideas. 

**Priority** -- you rank order top 5 ideas and select your project choice.  

**Research and background document** -- your background research into the topic, including scientific, technological, policy aspects. More detail soon. The audience for this document is the teaching team. 

**High-level storyboard** -- Early drafts of your play which represents the ideas from your 

**Final Recording** -- A 3 act play that communicates the wish and the solution. 
                    -- Act.1: Realized wish in the future
                    -- Act.2: Crisis 
                    -- Act.3: Journey 
                    
**Team reviews** -- we will share a link via Canvas after the project are submitted so that each team can determine their team-work score.

What do we mean by...

**CLARITY**

- Is the topic clear?
- Is there a clear and cohesive message directed at your specific audience? 
- Data, images, plots, if any, are easy to follow and are clearly labeled 
- Is the presentation self-explanatory?
- Limited use of jargon

**EMPATHY FOR AUDIENCE**

- Is the intended audience obvious?
- Why should the audience care about this topic/find it relevant or useful?
- Are the messages appropriate for the target audience? Is it sensitive to the audience? 
- Will the audience be engaged by the presentation? 
- Is the medium in the service of the audience and topic?
- Does the project serve the stated audience? 

**SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY**

- Is any science or engineering represented technically correct?
- Do you reference multiple independent, reputable sources? 
- Is the relevance or connection to bioengineering clearly articulated?

**SIZZLE FACTOR**

- Is the project appealing and engaging? 
- Is the execution quality high? (e.g., not a first draft, but polished work)
