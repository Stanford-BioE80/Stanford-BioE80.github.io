We will host your projects on the class website.

# Final Project Rubric (15% of grade)

**Team Rules - 6pts**

**Brainstorming - 30pts**

**Picking an Audience, Topic, and Medium - 30pts**

**Team Work - 4 pts**

**Final Deliverable - 30 pts**


Your team’s final project deliverable should be a “presentation” in a format that can be easily shared and experienced by any interested party (e.g., a video, article, recording, podcast, or any other digital artifact). 

Your target audience should expect to spend not more than 5 minutes experiencing your project. 

Please turn in your final project **not later than 5p on Thursday 6 June.  Early submissions are welcome.**

You will NOT need to do a formal presentation or report in class.   Your final project takes the place of a final exam (i.e., there is no final exam for this course).

**Please also see the example at the bottom.**  Please, please ask us if you have any questions.   


## GRADING


**Team Rules** -- graded as part of Project Activity 1

**Brainstorming** -- graded as part of Project Activity 1

**Picking Audience, Topic, & Medium** -- graded as part of Project Activity 2

**Team Work** -- we will share a link via Canvas after the project are submitted so that each team can determine their team-work score.


## Final Deliverable 


**CLARITY - 7 pts**

- Is the topic clear?
- Is there a clear and cohesive message directed at your specific audience? 
- Data, images, plots, if any, are easy to follow and are clearly labeled 
- Is the presentation self-explanatory?
- Limited use of jargon

**EMPATHY FOR AUDIENCE - 10 pts**

- Is the intended audience obvious?
- Why should the audience care about this topic/find it relevant or useful?
- Are the messages appropriate for the target audience? Is it sensitive to the audience? 
- Will the audience be engaged by the presentation? 
- Is the medium in the service of the audience and topic?
- Does the project serve the stated audience? 

**SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY - 10 pts**

- Is any science or engineering represented technically correct?
- Do you reference two or more independent, reputable sources? 
- Is clear guidance provided for how an interested audience member could learn more, on their ownn
- Is the relevance or connection to bioengineering clearly articulated?

**SIZZLE FACTOR - 3 pts**

- Is the project appealing and engaging? 
- Does the audience want to know more after engaging with this material?
- Is the execution quality high? (e.g., not a first draft, but polished work)

**Reflection Document to Help Address Above**

To help you earn all the credit you deserve for each of these four topics please also turn in four paragraphs detailing exactly how you addressed each topic within the context of your project (max. of 200 words per paragraph).  


**Does the above not make enough sense?  That’s reasonable.  Let’s consider a specific example to help advance your thinking:**

Let’s say you wish to introduce student athletes (primary audience) and others (secondary audiences) to the topic of regenerative medicine.  By what medium might you best reach student athletes?  You can answer this question well by first considering who are student athletes, what do they care about uniquely (compared to a broader generic audience), and where do they spend their time, doing what?  If you can answer these sorts of questions then you have a better chance of developing materials and organizing your materials into a format to produce a final project that actually has a chance of both reaching and informing your target audience.  So, let’s see… what if there was a video message from other student athletes that could play on the big display at Maples Pavilion during time outs in the basketball or volleyball games?  What if there was an animated short or slide show that played on the displays in the weight rooms?  What if the Stanford Band or Dollies developed a new song, dance, or program?  What if you carefully and responsibly edited a team’s hype video to let them know how exciting regenerative medicine and bioengineering can be?  You see!  It’s easy once you think a little bit about your audience and take them seriously!
