## FINAL PROJECT INTRODUCTION

**Your Wish, Your Plan, Your Play**

Your final project has three major parts: (1) your wish, (2) your plan, and (3) your play.  

Class projects must be submitted electronically via a link that will be shared later! We will host your projects on the class website.

## LEARNING GOALS & MOTIVATION

Our goal with the group project is to empower you to think about and plan for the future you wish to realize or contribute to via bioengineering.  We aim to enable you to devise and express your **wish** that can be implemented via bioengineering by of before the year 2030.  We will help you develop a practical plan for realizing your wish.  Finally, we will ask you to represent your wishes and plans as a story  (specifically, as a 3-act play that you make and record via Zoom with your team).   

Independent of your academic level, whether a first-year or a graduating senior, we hope that the class project will enable you to take steps towards organizing your plans.  As a first-year, the project may help you decide what other courses to take in the future (i.e., serve as a cornerstone to your curriculum).  As a graduating senior, the project may help you reflect on what you have learned and use them in realizing your next steps, and may even serve as the first-draft of a specific plan for what you do next.  

## PROJECT COMPONENTS & POINT ALLOCATIONS

You and your team will have to complete the following deliverables as part of the project.  Some of the delieverables are do along the way. I.e., not everything is turned in at the end of quarter.

***Team rules (6 pts)***

***Brainstorm and ideation (5 pts)***

***Priority setting and project selection (10 pts)***

***Written Project Description (24 pts, 3 points per)***

	Answer the following eight questions (adapted from DARPA's Heilmeier Catechism):
  
    1. What are you trying to do? Succintly articulate your wish using absolutely no jargon.
    
	  2. What's happening today, what is the problem, or what are the limits of current practice?
    
	  3. What is new in your approach and why do you think you will be successful?
    
	  4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will your success make?
    
    5. What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
    
	  6. What is the greatest obstacle to your success?
    
	  7. What could go horribly wrong? What are the risks?
    
	  8. How much will it cost?  How long will it take?

***High-level storyboard (25 pts)***
    Act 1 -- Your wish has come  true (key dialog, scene detailsm and mood setting re: your wish being true (i.e., living in the future)) 
    Act 2 -- Despair, challenge, disaster (ditto but re: the most dramatic challenge encountered in making wish true)
    Act 3 -- Path to victory (ditto but re: the most important success realized along the path to success)

***Final Recording of Play's Performance (25 pts)***
	
***Internal team member reviews (5 pts)***

There will be additional information and deadlines for each deliverable.
Briefly, your team’s final recording should be a 9-12 min zoom recording of your play, each Act being 3-4 min long. 
Please turn in your final project **not later than 5p on Thursday 11 June.** 

You will NOT need to do a formal presentation or report in class.   

Please ask us if you have any questions.   

## GRADING RUBRIC AND ADVICE

**Team Rules** -- you and your group decide your rules. 

**Brainstorming** -- your list of ideas. 

**Priority** -- you rank order top 5 ideas and select your project choice.  

**Research and background document** -- your background research into the topic, including scientific, technological, policy aspects. More detail soon. The audience for this document is the teaching team. 

**High-level storyboard** -- Early drafts of your play which represents the ideas from your 

**Final Recording** -- A 3 act play that communicates the wish and the solution. 
                    -- Act.1: Realized wish in the future
                    -- Act.2: Crisis 
                    -- Act.3: Journey 
                    
**Team reviews** -- we will share a link via Canvas after the project are submitted so that each team can determine their team-work score.

What do we mean by...

**CLARITY**

- Is the topic clear?
- Is there a clear and cohesive message directed at your specific audience? 
- Data, images, plots, if any, are easy to follow and are clearly labeled 
- Is the presentation self-explanatory?
- Limited use of jargon

**EMPATHY FOR AUDIENCE**

- Is the intended audience obvious?
- Why should the audience care about this topic/find it relevant or useful?
- Are the messages appropriate for the target audience? Is it sensitive to the audience? 
- Will the audience be engaged by the presentation? 
- Is the medium in the service of the audience and topic?
- Does the project serve the stated audience? 

**SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY**

- Is any science or engineering represented technically correct?
- Do you reference multiple independent, reputable sources? 
- Is the relevance or connection to bioengineering clearly articulated?

**SIZZLE FACTOR**

- Is the project appealing and engaging? 
- Is the execution quality high? (e.g., not a first draft, but polished work)
