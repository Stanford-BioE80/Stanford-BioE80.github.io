## Introduction |Technology, Tools, and Trends (DNA read and write)

This week we will explore **What changes may arise via trends in DNA read andwrite tools may matter for the rest of our lives?**  We hope you will learn more about the core capacities for accessing and encoding DNA and also consider thequantitative pacing of how these tools are improving.  This pre-class materialfocuses mostly on DNA sequencing...

**Goal 1:** You should be able to describe how DNA sequencing works.

**Goal 2:** You should be able to describe the pace of developments in DNAread and write and be ready to discuss the ramifications of thisdevelopment.

Let’s begin!

## Example 1: Non-invasive prenatal testing

Put yourself in the shoes of a couple who recently discovered they were pregnant, andare worried about genetic disorders in their unborn child (e.g., Down syndrome).

**Scenario-1:** It is 2010 and the standard of care is amniocentesis, an invasive procedurein which a large needle is used to directly sample fluid from the amniotic sac [optional link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXIW8GHwJ_M)

**Q.1. What do you think about the test, would you take it? Why?**

**Scenario-2:** It is 2018 and in leading-edge children’s hospitals amniocentesis has beenreplaced by non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), previously known as cell free DNA testing. NIPT is based on a simple blood draw that enables determination of geneticdisorders and even the sex of an unborn fetus. The test works because it turns out that there is DNA from the fetus circulating in the pregnant woman’s blood (e.g., if apregnant woman has Y chromosome DNA in her blood then she is carrying a malefetus). Please watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e86_l_UqecU) about cell free fetal DNA analysis if you want moredetail.

**Q.2. Do you think NIPT could have been economically feasible in the year 2010?What about 2000, or 1990? Why?**

**Q.3. What factors do you think led to exponential cost reduction in DNA sequencing?**

## Example 2: DNA literacy (DNA read)

DNA is made up of nucleotides. These nucleotideshave four possible bases; 
adenine (A), thymine (T),guanine (G), and cytosine (C). All DNA is made up of sequences of these four bases. Imagine a four key typewriter that is able to type the DNA codes for all of the biodiversity seen on earth. Being able to both **read DNA** (sequencing) and **write DNA** (synthesizing) has and will continue to givebioengineers the ability to design and build with livingmatter in ways that were hard to imagine very recently.

Let’s delve into how current sequencing technologies work.

Start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuYATh7Y74) that provides backgroundabout sequencing and its use to decode the human genome, with a focus on “massivelyparallel sequencing” (often marketed as “next-generation” sequencing technology). Figure-2, also breaks down the same process described in the video.

**Figure.2.** "Breakdown of DNA sequencing steps (specifically next generationsequencing). In this approach instead of reading a long sequence of DNA one baseper at a time, the sequence is divided into many pieces (fragments) which are all read simultaneously". [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24286.pdf)

During sequencing first, the genomic DNA (the DNA that we want to read) is broken into smaller pieces (fragmented). Then a synthetic linker sequence is added to the end ofthe fragments (adaptor) which helps the DNA fragments get attached to a surface on which the sequencing happens (flow cell). Next, the DNA fragments are separated inspace and read individually. Each fragment is amplified (thousands of copies of eachpiece is made) to make sure the correct sequence is detected. To actually read the fragments, pre-labeled nucleotides (nucleotides with color) and enzymes (that incorporate nucleotides into the fragments) are added to the flow cell. As each colored base pair is added to the fragments a new colorful spot is introduced. By taking images from the spots we are able to decode the sequence. Finally, the fragments are stitched together to reveal the original sequence of the genomic DNA. Here is an additional video that describes this process in even more detail [optional link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8).

**Q.4. According to the “How to sequence the human genome” video when was thefirst human genome sequenced? How long did it take? How much did it cost?**

**Q.5. How much would it cost if you were to sequence the human genome in 2018?**

**Q.6. Thinking back to the design, build, and test (DBT) class. What are theconsequences of lowering sequencing cost (both money and time)?**

***Hobbes, State of War, Qualitative Change***

This week we are exploring **What changes may arise via trends in DNA read andwrite tools that could matter for the rest of our lives?**  Thus far we’ve discussedquantitative changes and some aspects of qualitative change, all for good. On Friday you will work actively in small teams to further explore and develop your own ideas.  In further preparation for Friday please consider the following possible negative consequences that may arise from advances in core bioengineering capacities...

**Goal-1:** You should be able to explore a potential “dark side” of bioengineeringwithout succumbing to evil (and hopefully just the opposite, become betterprepared to do good).

**Goal-2:** You should further upgrade your capacity to discuss and developexamples of possible quantitative and qualitative changes resulting from ongoingadvances in biology and bioengineering.

Let’s begin!

## Quick Background

We’ll discuss Hobbes et al. in more detail later this quarter.  For now simply note thatHobbes is recognized as one of the founders of modern political theory (i.e., how peopleare organized into societies).  His most famous work “Leviathan” published in 1651develops the “social contract” as a practical theory for uniting people under a commongovernment.  To quote,

*“Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called War; and such a war asis of every man against every man.”
[...]
“In such condition there is no place for Industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving andremoving such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; 
no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual Fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, andshort.”*

According to Hobbes, each of us find it to be in our own self interest to cede some ofour individual liberty to a common government and, in turn, we individually and collectively benefit so long as the government keeps others from harming us and eachother, etc. But what if the government cannot keep us from harm?  Then Hobbes’ social contract might collapse ...

**Q1. Hobbes’ reasoning depends on a model for human behavior.  Do you think Hobbes’ is correct in his assessment of intrinsic human nature? How humans would behave if we were subject to no common authority.  Can you imagine a different model for human behavior?**

## Case Study:  Pox Virus Synthesis

Very recently, in Jan. 2018 researchers in Alberta Canada published a paper reportingthat they had synthesized from scratch all the DNA encoding the horsepox virus andrecovered infectious virus particles.  You can access their entire paper for free here: [link](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188453)

Their work was the first report of humans ever synthesizing any pox virus from scratch.

**Q2. According to the authors, why did they synthesize horsepox?**

Horsepox is genetically very similar to the human pathogen smallpox.  ~400 millionpeople died from smallpox during the 20th century.  The World Health Organizationlaunched a massive effort to eradicate the disease and they succeeded, with the lastreported natural case occurring in 1977.   So successful was the eradication campaignthat most people are no longer vaccinated against smallpox.  Thus, not everyone wasexcited to read a public report demonstrating how to construct a pox virus from scratch. For example, acclaimed Stanford microbiologist and doctor David Relman posted the following to the article’s comment section,

*"This paper should not have been published.
To suggest that poxviruses are no different from influenza or polio, and therefore thatthe details provided here "provided no new information" [about the synthesis of smallpox], is at best misleading, and better characterized as simply wrong. 
I could list for you the details provided in this paper that will substantively assist those with lesser degrees of experience to synthesize smallpox. The Committee mentioned compliance with relevant regulations. Which regulations are these, and how are they relevant and specific to this work at the University of Alberta? The so-called 'forthcoming' behavior incommunications consisted of a presentation to the WHO Advisory Committee of a'fait-accompli'. To my knowledge, there was no request for guidance before the workwas undertaken. And the alleged benefits from this work simply do not hold water. This work was not needed or particularly helpful towards an improved vaccine. What I find particularly inappropriate and frankly, unethical is that this paper with its obvious risks to public health was funded by and written by a for-profit, private entity (Tonix) that stands to gain money from this work and this paper. And the authors co-founded and consult for this entity and stand to make money from it. The conflicts of interest are obvious: the public health was put at risk by a private entity and a set of author-business partners who stand to gain financially from this work. This is wrong.”*

**Q3. Why is David Relman upset?** 

**Q4. Do you think this work should have been published?** 


## Case Study-2: Responsible Bioengineering

Being mindful of such future possibilities over 10 years ago, bioengineers and policyexperts organized conversations to think ahead about potential problems associatedwith ongoing advances in DNA synthesis technologies.  They announced their findingsvia a report entitled, “Synthetic Genomics: Options for Governance.”  

Skim thedecade-old press release here: [link](https://www.jcvi.org/new-policy-report-outlines-options-governance-synthetic-genomics)

And, only if you want, note the full report online here (WARNING. long read):
 [link](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/39141)

This report fed into a US federal government policy making process that resulted in theUS sequence screening guidelines now in place for DNA synthesis companies.  For example:
[link](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/guidance/syndna/Pages/default.aspx)

**Q5. According to the press release, what types of people (i.e., experts) wereinvolved in developing options for governing DNA synthesis tools?  Do you thinkit was essential to include more than just academic bioengineers?**

**Q6. What do you think would happen if you requested the DNA encoding ahuman pathogen via the Free Genes project?**

**Q7. Do you imagine that the DNA sequence screening guidelines developed forcommercial DNA synthesis ~10 years ago will be sufficient to guard againstmal-intentioned actors 10 years from now?**

**Q8. Is it easier to imagine a negative change or a positive change?  E.g., is it easier to imagine a new way to destroy the world or a positive improvement tomodern society?** 


## Preclass Reading for Fridy  

### Meet Your Microbes!

After finishing this activity:

**Goal-1:** You will have been introduced to basic methods for cultivating andcategorizing 
microbial life in the lab; it turns out we can only cultivate ~1% of microbes found in nature in the lab 
(i.e., we can’t grow most microbes underlaboratory conditions, at least not yet).

**Goal-2:** You have been introduced to the diversity of the life (microbiome) that
live in and on you (are you?). And, begin to describe the role that the microbiome plays in your health and well being.

**Goal-3:** By observing this diversity of microbial phenotypes you will have theopportunity to appreciate the rich diversity and engineering potential that livingmatter provides.

In an earlier activity we used a Foldscope to observe and explore the world around us,either as explorers or makers looking for parts and inspiration. In today’s activity we willexplore the *microbiome* that lives on and within us.
The microbiome is the vast collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes thatshare our bodies (additional [link](https://www.nature.com/collections/stkpgwjvvk/content/content). Depending on their context they can play a positive
or a negative role in our health and well being. For example, they can cause orinfluence non-communicable diseases. Engineering the microbiome is considered by some respected academics to be part of the the future of medicine. For example,researchers at Cornell recently engineered a gut microbe to address aspects of diabetes 
(see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626737)).

**Q.1. What do you think are various methods that we can use to study themicrobiome (i.e., all bacteria in and on you)? How can we tell what microbes arepresent in the microbiome?**

Thinking back to observing via your Foldscope, looking at microbes is certainly onemethod to study microbes. 
Figure-2 (below) are photographs of multiplebacteria and fungal colonies. You may notice the different colors, shapes, sizes, andstructures of these colonies. Some of the colonies have a smooth morphology whileothers have a more folded surface. You may begin to ask what are the advantages of having a smooth, or folded, or a rough surface. You may also use this diversity of properties as a possible approach to discern various microorganisms from one another.  However there is one important caveat to keep in mind, the diversity of microbial worldis incredible but we can only cultivate for study approximately 1% of the microbes thatlive on you. This is in part because many microbes are highly “social” and dwell in andamong communities of other microbes. We still have much to learn about the 1% we can cultivate, with plenty more to learn from the 99% we can’t yet grow.

**Figure-2**  Photographs of multiple bacteria and fungal colonies.  It is possible to identify bacterial or fungal species by the shape, color, and structure of the colonies that they form. 


**Q.2. If we cannot cultivate and grow many components of the microbiome inisolation in the lab, how can we tell what is present in each context? Whatcontemporary technologies have enabled the study and engineering of themicrobiome?**

Think about your own answer and then visit the following link to begin to answer the above question [Scientists Unveil New ‘Tree of Life’](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/science/scientists-unveil-new-tree-of-life.html)


While the plate assays (growing bacteria on defined media) and looking at growth andphenotypes, may seem simple. They have and continue to play an incredibly powerfulrole in the discovery and development of biology as well as in the pursuit of bioengineering.[source](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/1147) demonstrates a creative and unique plateassay called MEGA-plate (“mega” since the plate is **2x4 feet!**) to demonstrate and study bacterial evolution. MEGA plate was used to study the evolution andemergence of antibiotic resistance over time in bacterial populations.

### What Next
During the class, you will use the plates that you prepared on Wednesday toexamine and classifying the microbes 
that grew on your plates. To prepare for this make sure to take a look at the first page of this
