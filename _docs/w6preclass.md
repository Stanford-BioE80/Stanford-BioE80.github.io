# Week 6 Preclass

Please read and consider the below before start of class on Monday.
The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.
Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.


## Introduction: Abstraction as a tool for managing complexity in bioengineering.

Welcome to the pre-class material for Abstraction as a tool for managing complexity in bioengineering. 

**Goal-1:** After Week 6 you will able to describe the role of abstraction as a tool for helping 
to managecomplexity in biological systems - with an emphasis on the design step of the engineering cycle.

**Goal-2:** You will also be able to apply abstraction (in the form of black box diagrams) to decompose 
or synthesize the designs systems that could then be implemented in living matter for example viaengineered 
(i.e., designer) DNA.

## Example-1:  Bacterial Flash Mob

**Q.1. Write down the DNA sequence encoding a dynamic bacterial flash mob (see animation below in Figure.1 ).Q1. What is the first base of your DNA program?  A, T, C, or G?  (Note: Do not spend more than 100 seconds pondering and answering this question.  Timeâ€™s up!).
