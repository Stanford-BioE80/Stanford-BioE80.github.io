# BIOE 80 Final Project (15% of Grade)
## Why is Bioengineering Important?

The goal of this project is for students to communicate the importance of Bioengineering to next year's BIOE 80 class.

In groups of 3-4, students will create a "BIOE 80 Wiki Post" identifying a current need and discussing the role that Bioengineering can take in developing solutions.
Student groups will create a Google Doc, Google Site, or other world-readable webpage with a vignette about Bioengineering.
Each of this quarter's pre-class material can be considered a sample project.

Assessment will be based on the following:

**Identification and Description of Need:** 20 points
* Instructors can offer suggested sources, ie: kiva.org
* Describe the problem and who is affected by it

**Description or proposal of bioengineering-based solution:** 35 points
* Provide relevant background for learning about the biology and technology utilized in the solution (ie: identify resources for getting more information)
* Describe advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this solution
* Describe what should happen for this solution to occur? (ie: development of technology, policy, etc.)

**Description of Social Ramifications:** 15 points
* Ethical implications of taking action
* Ethical implications of inaction

**References:** 10 points
* Students should include citations, as appropriate

**Structure:** 10 points
* Clarity, Spelling, Grammar, etc.
