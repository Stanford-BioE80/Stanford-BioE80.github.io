## If we can construct a genome then why can't we build an organism?

Please read and consider the below before start of class. The questions given are only study questions not homework to be answered. Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

## Preclass for Wednesday

In the past weeks, you have learned about the engineering cycle (design, build, test) and the core capacities and trends of sequencing and synthesizing DNA. This week we begin by learning about the synthesis of a minimal bacterial genome.

Goal-1: In the context of the minimal bacterial genome, you will explore the question if we can construct a genome then why can’t we build an organism?

Goal-2: Your additional goal is to read a research paper (primary sources) on the frontiers of bioengineering. Ability to read and understand primary sources is a core skill that you will need both as a student and beyond college.

Your task is the read *"Design and synthesis of a minimalbacterial genome"* 
 [link](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/aad6253) and answer the following five questions. 

You do not need to understand everything– feel free to skim over many details. 
That said –if you are curious to understand how things were actually done, go for it – everything in the paper 
should be accessible to you with some time and search. 

Your answers to the questions below are not graded  – they are for you – but they will be useful for the in-class session on Monday. 

**Q.1. Using your own words, describe what the authors did?**

**Q.2. What was the most surprising thing that the scientists discovered or learned?**

**Q.3. What  were  the  major  technology and engineering  barriers,  that  made  this  project  
impossible  until recently? Give two or three examples.**

**Q.4. Give two simple design, build, and test (DBT) rules the research team discovered.**

**Q.5. Thinking ahead, what do you think the authors might do next – what they might be 
working on right now, given that he announced JCVI3.0 to the world back in 2016?**
