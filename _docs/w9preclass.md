Please read and consider the below before start of class. The questions given are only study questions not homework to be answered. Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

## Preclass for Wednesday 
   
(1) Please read the brief article, *"George the Snail, Believed to Be the Last of His Species, Dies at 14 in Hawaii.”*

Available online via: [George the Snail, Believed to Be the Last of His Species, Dies at 14 in Hawaii](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/science/snail-dead-george-species.html)  
(And, also shared as a .PDF file via email)

*Self-study Questions:*

**Q.1. What fraction of Hawaiian snail species have gone extinct in the last several hundred years?**  

**Q.2. What three factors are thought or known to have contributed to snail extinctions on Hawaii?**  

**Q.3. What hope motivated deep-freezing a two millimeter slice of George’s foot in 2017?** 


(2) Please skim the article by our own Michael Specter, *“Could Genetically Modified Mosquitoes Save Hawaii’s Endangered Birds?”*  

Available online via: [Could Genetically Modified Mosquitoes Save Hawaii’s Endangered Birds?](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/could-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-save-hawaiis-endangered-birds)   
(And, also shared as a .PDF file via email)

*Self-study Questions:*

**Q.4. How do mosquitoes contribute to the extinction of native Hawaiian birds?**  

**Q.5. Why are there mosquitos on Hawaii?**   

(3) Please consider the video introduction to *“gene drives”* available here: [What's a gene drive?](https://youtu.be/KgvhUPiDdq8)   
Please pay special attention to the 2.5 minutes of material starting around 30 seconds into the video.   

*Self-study Questions:* 

**Q.6. What is a gene drive?**

[See](https://youtu.be/KgvhUPiDdq8?t=30)   

**Q.7. What is CRISPR?**   

[See](https://youtu.be/KgvhUPiDdq8?t=54)   

**Q.8. What is the key insight enabling CRISPR-enabled gene drives?**    

[See](https://youtu.be/KgvhUPiDdq8?t=98) (Hint — listen for when the narrator exclaims, “…also contained a little bit of code…”)   


## Preclass for Friday 

How to read a research paper:

(0) DO NOT SIT DOWN AND READ THE ENTIRE PAPER.  STOP.  DO WHAT FOLLOWS INSTEAD.

(1) Read the title.  Does it make any sense?  Note words you don’t understand.

(2) Read the abstract.  Find the single most apparent or remarkable claim.  

(3) If you fail to find any main claim from the abstract don’t bother reading the paper.

(4) Skim the figures, looking for evidence in support of the main claim.

(5) If you can’t find clear and apparent evidence in support of the main claim stop spending time on the paper.

STOP HERE REGARDLESS AND DECIDE IF YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO SPEND ON THE PAPER

(6-10) If you are spending more time on the paper the next thing to do if to find the main weakness or limitation of the work.  This requires much more effort, beyond scope of Intro to BIOE.

**Papers** 

1. [A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive system targeting female reproduction in the malaria mosquito vector *Anopheles
gambiae*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3439)

2. [Identification of an infectious progenitor for the multiple-copy HERV-K human endogenous retroelements](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/12/1548.long)
