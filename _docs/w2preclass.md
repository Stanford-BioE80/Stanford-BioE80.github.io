## Preclass for Monday
### People health (what do people need of bioengineers?)
The intersection of Bioengineering and human health is an active and exciting area of research. 
To better discuss the role that bioengineering can play -in addressing challenges in human health- briefly skim the following, The Burden of Disease and the Changing Task of Medicine, available from [link-1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1113569) and also a summary of the same material from [link-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/leading-causes-of-death-from-1900-2010-2012-6?op=1).  

**Q.1. What is the definition of burden of disease?**

**Q.2. How has the burden of disease for various diseases changed over time?**

Next, familiarize yourself with some background information on malaria from the two links:

1. [WHO - 10 facts on Malaria](https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/)

2. [CDC- Malaria](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/malaria/index.html)

**Q.3. What causes malaria? and how is malaria spread?**

**Q.4. How is malaria diagnosed and treated?**  

**Q.5. What are the challenges associated with 'drug resistance'?**

*Optional reading:  
The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015 to Youyou Tu for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria
[Optional Link-1](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/press-29.pdf),
[Optional Link-2](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/summary/)*

One approach to address malaria with bioengineering is to produce drugs, or key ingredients of a medication, via engineered organisms (example engineered yeast).  See optional link for a primary research paper [High-level semi-synthetic production of the potent antimalarial artemisinin](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12051).  

Now take a look at the following articles describing the reaction of the market to Synthetic biology's first malaria drug.

[Synthetic biology's first malaria drug meets market resistance](https://www.nature.com/news/synthetic-biology-s-first-malaria-drug-meets-market-resistance-1.19426?WT.ec_id=NEWS-20160225&spMailingID=50779167&spUserID=MzcwMzk3NDYwODcS1&spJobID=863136582&spReportId=ODYzMTM2NTgyS0)

**Q.6. What was the only source of artemisinin before synthetic production?**

**Q.7. What were the challenges that the synthetic drug faced ?**

**Q.8. What steps could have prevented some of those challenges?**

*Optional reading:  
Interview with Dr. Jay Keasling ' whose work led to the industrial production of this important drug in yeast using synthetic biology.'
[Optional Link-3](https://www.twistbioscience.com/company/blog/dr-jay-keasling)*

Later we will also talk about [**Gene-Drives**](https://wyss.harvard.edu/media-post/crispr-cas9-gene-drives/) as a potential solution to address diseases such as malaria. If you have time and wish to get a start on learning about Gene-Drives, check out this article [The Perils and Promises of Gene-Drive Technology](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-perils-and-promises-of-gene-drive-technology) by Michael Specter.

## Preclass for Wednesday

### Planet health (what does everything else “need”?)
**Extinction of Species and Bioengineering**

In the 1960s, 2300 Northern White Rhinos lived in the wild. 
By the 1990s, their population was estimated to be a few dozens. In 2008, they were believed to be extinct in the wild. On March 20, 2018, the last male northern white rhinoceros named Sudan died at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. A team of vets put the 45-year-old Sudan to rest when his age-related health complications took a turn for the worse.  Two female rhinos Sudan’s daughter (Najin), and granddaughter (Fatu) are what that is remaining of the northern white rhinos. Northern white rhinoceros were functionally extinct before the death of Sudan. Since neither Najin and are capable of natural reproduction. Currently, the only way to save the northern white is to artificially inseminate their eggs with stored sperm from Sudan and other males, and implant the resulting eggs into females of the closely related southern white rhino. [source-1](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/sudan-northern-white-rhino-death/556058/), [source-2](https://time.com/5209390/sudan-rhino-rhinoceros-northern-white/), [source-3](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/science/rhino-sudan-extinct.html). 

*Optional reading: An Endling is the last known individual of a species or subspecies. Once the endling dies, the species becomes extinct [Optional Link-1:Endling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endling), [Optional Link-2: what do you call the last of a species](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/what-do-you-call-the-last-of-a-species)*

Excessive hunting mostly caused the mass of extinction of rhinos. Despite its devastating effects, excessive hunting and poaching is not the only (or the primary cause of) extinction of the species and rapid loss of biodiversity. 

**Climate change** and **Moving species** around the world (due to human movement) are other significant factors causing the extinction of species. Let's focus on moving species for now. 

While this seems ordinary, we routinely (intentionally or otherwise) move species around the globe at a rapid rate. Moving species around the world can often bring together two species that have never encountered one another and have evolved along distinct evolutionary paths. 

This introduction can have a distributive and devastating effect. For example, the intentional introduction of Pacific rats to New Zealand had a devastating impact on the population of many flightless birds that had no previous predators. Another example is the introduction of pathogens, e.g., fungal diseases. For example, White-nose syndrome devastated the population of bats in northern America and led the Panamanian Golden Frog to extinction in the wild. 

White-nose syndrome (WSN) is a disease affecting hibernating bats. White-nose syndrome is a disease affecting hibernating bats. Many laboratories and state and federal biologists are investigating the cause of the bat deaths. A fungus discovered in 2008, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or pd, (formerly Geomyces destructans), has been demonstrated to cause WNS. Scientists are investigating the dynamics of fungal infection and transmission, and searching for a way to control it.

**Q.1. Could bioengineering help us revive and restore extinct species? If yes, how?**

**Q.2.Could bioengineering help us eliminate ( or reduce) invasive species?** 

**Q.3. Could bioengineering help us eliminate factors accelerating ecosystem damage or change?**

Briefly familiarize yourself with the following project [Revive & Restore](https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/).  As you see, the project seeks to 'De-Extinct' and revive woolly mammoths using genetic engineering and cloning.

**Q.4. What challenges might the bioengineers face in reviving woolly mammoths?**

**Q.5. If successful-  what challenges the woolly mammoths might face?**

**Q.6. Could bioengineering help us establish life somewhere else (e.g., Mars)? If yes, who should decide?**

*Optional reading: 
[De-Extinction Debate: Should We Bring Back the Woolly Mammoth?](https://e360.yale.edu/features/the_case_for_de-extinction_why_we_should_bring_back_the_woolly_mammoth). and [The Living Planet Index](https://livingplanetindex.org/projects?main_page_project=AboutTheIndex&home_flag=1)

Looking ahead to Friday's class and if you would like a thought-provoking essay by Ursula K. Le Guin, please find [She Unnames Them](http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2013_01.dir/pdf4gQ1dofjT0.pdf)

## Preclass for Friday 	

### Political health (what does it mean to engineer biology at social scales?)

In getting started please familiarize yourself with the thinking of Hobbes and Rousseau.  

Both explored tradeoffs between individual rights and the formation of collective government (i.e., the social contract):  

Briefly introduce yourself to Hobbes’ thinking regarding the formation of government via the four 
paragraphs that start with, "In Leviathan, Hobbes set out his 
doctrine of the foundation ofstatesand legitimate governments..."
[link Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes#Leviathan)

Similarly introduce yourself to Rousseau's thinking by studying the eight paragraphs that begin with, 
"Rousseau's text is divided into four main parts..."
[link Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Inequality#Argument)

**Q.1. How do Rousseau’s assumptions about human nature differ from Hobbes’?** 

**Q.2. How might such assumptions lead to differences in terms of how people are organized, or organize themselves?**

Next, please skim the 2018 NY Times article, [“As D.I.Y. Gene Editing Gains Popularity, ‘Someone Is Going to Get Hurt’”](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/science/biohackers-gene-editing-virus.html)

**Q.3. Do you think bioengineers should be licensed?**

please next skim the essay by John Maynard Keynes, "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren"

<a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf</a>

**Q.4.  What was the state of the global economy when Keynes published his essay?**

**Q.5.  Who are Keynes “grandchildren” and what does Keynes conclude regarding their future economic prospects?**

**Q.6.  Did Keynes' prediction come true?**

Second, please study in detail the paragraph in Tom Jefferson’s letter to John Adams, sent 28 October 1813, that starts with the text, "With respect to Aristocracy we should further consider that…”

[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6189](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6189)

**Q.7.  What is the significance of land to Jefferson in his argument here?**

**Q.8.  What does Jefferson argue is required for all to have an interest in law and order?**

**Q.9.  What is the equivalent of land in 2019?  For the rest of the 21st century?**
