## Material for Monday 

Please read and consider the below before start of class. The questions given are only study questions not homework to be answered. Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

### How do engineers actually engineer with, of, and for biology?

Here you will examine the role of the core engineering cycle -- "Design, Build, and Test" -- and specifically its application to engineering with, of, and for living matter. After considering the following examples and class next week... 

**Goal-1:** You will be able to describe the engineering cycle, design-build-test (DBT), and the central role it plays in (bio)engineering, and how DBT can be utilized at different scales (from one person to whole industry sectors).

**Goal-2:** When faced with a challenge, you will be able to articulate your goal, specify your design needs, and develop a plan for designing, building, and testing your solution.

**Goal-3:** By the end of this week, you will be able to describe the DBT framework as a dynamic process in response to the current needs (social, technological, environmental, etc.), and begin to consider what DBT will look like in the future. 

Let's begin:

### Example 1 - What does it mean to "Engineer a Solution"?

Every day we make innumerable choices about how to act, how to manage our time, how to complete a tough question in a problem set, what we should eat for lunch, and so on. Each decision we make forms a solution, a choice that we "enact to solve the problems in front of us. But have you ever thought about the decision process itself: How do we provide a solution to a problem? In our lives, the choices might be simple. Even when they're challenging (“I have one day to complete 5 assignments. How will I do it??") and the consequences are mitigated. But what about if the solution you’re engineering is a resolution of global hunger? Or a new cancer therapeutic with little-to-no side effects? Here, when the stakes are high and the options are limitless a common (and incredibly important) framework - the** Design-Build-Test (DBT) cycle** - can help us wade through the choices and toward success ([image](http://www.makemyownsite.com/loc_ms/step4_test.html)). 

As a specific example to start with, [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/about) is a charity that has a unique approach to the alleviation of wants and needs. Instead of soliciting donations, Kiva provides a platform for individuals and groups around the world to request loans for their cause, empowering them to build a better future for themselves, their families, and their community.

**Take a few minutes to browse the Kiva website, noting the geographic location of the groups you see and their goals.**

**Q.1.** What is your initial response to the Kiva platform? Do you find anything striking?

Kiva breaks down into different topics, allowing the potential lender to filter by the topic they find the most compelling. Looking at a few of the most common loan requests and we can extract a general structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Campaign...</td>
    <td>Goal / Use of Loan...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cruz Celina, Hùng, Loan</td>
    <td>Buying materials to build a latrine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Channy's Group, Sreymai’s Group</td>
    <td>Buying water filters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane’s Group, Sin Kyoe(2)D Village Group, Zulaykha
</td>
    <td>Buying fertilizer, seed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kantiembou Group, Dumitru, Glenda, Zhanybek</td>
    <td>Buying livestock</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This focuses on solving problems immediately by providing (consuming) products as they currently exist. In this class, we have the opportunity to step outside the bounds of current offerings by thinking about **designing** and **building better** products that fix unmet **needs**.

The first step toward this different approach requires us to really understand why the current solution is being used. To do that, let's consider the loans above that ask for money to buy livestock. Why? Because while we haven’t all necessarily raised livestock on a farm, many of us have interacted with animals in some way.

Think about how we - as humans - interact with all types of animals: cats, dogs, horses, cows, sheep, etc. What resources do we get from these interactions? What functions could the animals be serving in our lives? Below is a list of some of the traditional (and more contemporary) human-animal interactions:

1. Companionship - the sheep could be their pets
2. Transportation - riding horses, etc
3. Food - meat, dairy, eggs, etc
4. Cloth - wool from sheep
5. Income - reselling of animals

**Q.2.** For each of the uses above, could you replace the function the animal serves with another solution/product? If yes, how?

**Q.3.** Think about when you might choose to use either the animal or your alternative approach.

For example, consider the [Kantiembou Group](https://www.kiva.org/lend/1486507). Aissata wants to buy sheep with a loan from Kiva supporters. 

**Q.4.** What function are the sheep serving? (What did Aissata plan to do with the sheep?)

**Q.5.** Revisit your ideas about how to replace this function. Would it be applicable in this case? Why or why not? How would you refine your idea given this specific circumstance/use case?

Now that we have begun to think outside the box, let's analyze in a broader sense the merits of each approach. While this example was used to help you relate to and begin to engage with the initial considerations of the Design-Build-Test cycle, it is not meant to belittle the massive progress toward correcting global injustices that has been enabled by attempts to provide immediate aid. With any problem - whether engineering a solution to social need or engineering a protein in the lab - there are multiple meritorious approaches. It is important to understand these merits, their limitations, and when they can and should be utilized. 

**Q.6. What are the pros and cons of providing access to current products (donating money, products themselves) versus changing the products to better address needs?** (Think of some considerations that would determine which approach you would use, such as resources you would need, time to completion, how easy it would be to implement, and how each would impact the stakeholders/people involved.)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Approach | Providing access to current resources (/solutions/products)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Approach | Creating new products (/solutions)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Faced with numerous pros and cons, it can be difficult to decide upon "the best" course of action. Luckily, the Design-Build-Test cycle provides a powerful framework to help refine the engineering of a solution.  

### Example 2 - Bioengineering via Design-Build-Test

What if, in a few years, you were given $35 million to fund clinical trials of a medicine based on one of your undergraduate bioengineering research projects? Applying Design-Build-Test appropriately can make this possible. For example...

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine that is triggered by eating gluten - a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye - and causes damage to the fingerlike projections lining your small intestine (villi) important for nutrient absorption ([figure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220)). It is estimated that 1% of the US population has celiac disease, but despite increasing attention in the media, almost 83% of those 3 million people remain undiagnosed (NOTE:  Beyond Celiac: What is Celiac Disease?). While misdiagnosis is common, some postulate that this lack of diagnosis (and awareness) can be linked to the limited clinical treatment offerings: currently, the only approved therapy is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Avoiding gluten can be difficult when there are hidden sources lurking around us (NOTE:  Medivizor: 300 facts you didn't know about gluten). Further, many who do adhere to a strict gluten-free diet do not see recovery of the small intestinal mucosa.

Recognizing the need for a true therapy, a 2011 undergraduate iGEM team (see igem.org) from the University of Washington began to design a drug that could potentially provide relief. Six years later, that drug (KumaMax) was funded to undergo phase I clinical trials to the tune of $35 million.  To learn more skim the following two websites:

[iGEM Startup PvP Biologics Closes a $35 Million Agreement with Pharmaceutical Company Takeda](https://synbiobeta.com/igem-startup-pvp-biologics-closes-35-million-agreement-pharmaceutical-company-takeda/) 

[UW iGEM Wiki: Gluten Destruction](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Celiacs/Background)

**Q.7.** According to the team's website, why had other approaches failed?

**Q.8.** What was unique about their approach?

**Q.9.** How did they choose their starting enzyme? What key design specification made this a great choice?

**Q.10.** How did they design their enzyme? What tools did they use?

**Q.11.** How did they test their enzyme?

**Q.12.** What would you have done differently?

This example highlights the power of the DBT framework applied to a bioengineering challenge. The students began with an enzyme that, by correctly navigating a DBT process, they were able to engineer into modified form that could breakdown gluten in the gut.

**Summary**

In this pre-class activity you were introduced to the engineering cycle: design, build, and test and its application to bioengineering. You utilized a needs finding approach to identify design constraints, and specifications to describe your designs and corresponding tests. You examined the application of this approach to real world challenges. Finally you practiced an application of DBT framework through the Celiac disease case study. In class this week you will be introduced to how to actually design, build and test biomolecules.

**Keywords:**

**Design-Build-Test Cycle** - A framework that provides structure to the process of engineering a solution to diverse problems.

**Design** - Developing a possible solution. Informed by your design specifications. 

**Needs** - The specific problem you would like to solve. 

**Design Specifications** - How your solution will behave. For example: I'm building a paper plane for the purpose of nudging awake your friend across the room. This plane needs to:

- Fly straight for 5 feet
- Be smaller than 4 inches across (to be inconspicuous)
- Weigh less than one ounce (you don't want to hurt your friend)
- Be recyclable (because you love the earth)

**Build** - Making a prototype. I.e., make your design in real life. 

**Test** - Check whether your design, when turned into reality, actually satisfies all of requirements.

## Material for Wednesday 

Please read and consider the below before start of class. Here, you will continue your examination of the Design-Build-Test process and how it can be used to engineering with, of, and for living matter. For reference, here are the goals for the material this week (provided in the pre-class material for Monday):

**Goal-1:** You will be able to describe the engineering cycle, design-build-test (DBT), and the central role it plays in (bio)engineering, and how DBT can be utilized at different scales (from one person to whole industry sectors).

**Goal-2:** When faced with a challenge, you will be able to articulate your goal, specify your design needs, and develop a plan for designing, building, and testing your solution.

**Goal-3:** By the end of this week, you will be able to describe the DBT framework as a dynamic process in response to the current needs (social, technological, environmental, etc.), and begin to consider what DBT will look like in the future. 

### Example 1 - Mosis: the shared implementation service heard 'round the world'

While many of you may not have heard of Mosis, you have probably - in one way or another - benefited from its existence. How, you ask?

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/m12WHkrXESrY2IzhocR3xw_img_0.png)

[Mosis](https://www.mosis.com/) (MEtal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) is a product of the VLSI revolution that changed the way we make the chips that power all of our electronics today. But _how_ did it pave the way for this drastic change? 

Before the advent of this shared implementation service, researchers and others looking to prototype and/or fabricate a chip had to be much more personally involved in the process of fabrication. Making masks was unreliable, which produced poor wafers. The best results came when you knew someone in the fab facility, and could tailor your design to their skills. In other words, there was a lack of standardization and a centralization of designing and building that increased latency and cost. 

Recognizing a need, the clever minds behind Mosis (Danny Cohen) sought to help lower these barriers to entry (cost, specialized knowledge, access to a foundry, etc). In doing so, they created the "fabless foundry" industry that has helped shape our society today.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5SEFE_49Ug) made by Mosis explaining the workflow for using their service. As you do, pay special attention to each step of the workflow, who is involved, and which part of the DBT cycle is shown.

**Q.1.** How does Mosis work? Specifically, what key feature makes this service better than others that had previously been used?

**Q.2.** If I am designing a chip, what advantage does Mosis provide? Why would I choose to use it?

**Q.3.** How does this differ from the DBT cycle we saw with KumaMax? Fill in the following table to compare and contrast the DBT workflow in each case.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>KumaMax</td>
    <td>Mosis</td>

(Additional resources: Reminiscences of the VLSI Revolution - Lynn Conway's memoir, see [here](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Memoirs/VLSI/Lynn_Conway_VLSI_Reminiscences.pdf)) 

As we have seen, engineering with biology has not yet undergone the same type of decoupling and standardization of difference aspects of the DBT cycle that ushered in massive change in other fields (standardization of screws, outsourcing chip fabrication with Mosis). But, wait! We are on the cusp of a revolution!

### Example 2 - The Free Genes Project: A synthetic biology shared implementation service?

Not too long ago, people who wanted to make customized DNA had to do so with their own two hands, spending months and months to construct and validate a single piece of a larger DNA sequence. Then, with the commercialization of DNA synthesis technologies, it was possible to order your favorite customized gene, but you had to pay the big bucks. Now, the [Free Genes Project](https://biobricks.org/freegenes/) wants to bring ideas of decoupling and the "fabless foundry" to the engineering of DNA.

**Q.1.** Go to the Free Genes Project website, and describe how it works. Who is responsible for which aspect?

**Q.2.** Compare this to the Mosis workflow outlined above. How is it similar or different? 


## Alternative Material for Wednesday (used in 2018)

(two pages of text plus six external links follow; 30’suggested time)

Your primary goal in studying this specific pre-class material is to understand, from historical developments in electronics that emerged over a generation ago, how qualitative structural changes in aDesign, Build, Test workflow can emerge over time –changes that impactwho does what type of workand why.


### Mead & Conway revolution

To get started quickly skim the following Wikipediaentry regarding the Mead & Conway revolution in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuit engineering: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_%26_Conway_revolution)

**Q.1.** Drawing fromthisarticle alone, what were some of the unique aspects orinnovations that contributed to the VLSI revolution?Consider this question specifically from the perspective of a design, build, and test workflow.

Next, please skim the followingtwo articles that describethe 1978 VLSI designcourse Lynn Conway offered at MITas well as the recognition they received in 1981 from Electronics, a trade magazine:

http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/VLSI/MIT78/MIT78.html

http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Awards/Electronics/ElectAchiev.html


**Q.2.** Building on your answer from Q1 and the two additional articles linked above, what more specific changes or new aspects of the design, build, test workflow did Mead and Conway implement?  


**Q.3.** How were their proposedchanges received at the time?  Did everyone like and benefit from them?  Who benefited?  Who, if anyone, was threatened?

Consider one practical legacy of what you’ve learnedso far that still exists and operates in support of research and development in electronicstoday, the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service(MOSIS).

Looking at the second linkjust above, note how almost any student or researchercan access manyof the most advanced silicon wafer fabrication platforms on Earth.

**Q4.**  What is a multi-project wafer (MPW)?

**Q5.**  When are designs next due in order to get space on a28nm resolution MPW fabrication run provided viathe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company?

**Q6.**  Giventhe above as context, and based on what you know thus far from talking with your friends or from your own direct experience in bioengineering or biology labs either at Stanford or before, how is the workflow in biology and bioengineering research different (if at all) from what is represented via the examples of VLSI design, multi-project wafers, and MOSIS?  

**Q7.**  Are any differences you note or can imagine via Q6 the result of intrinsic physical differences betweensilicon-based systems versus living systems, or more to do with how people choose to organize themselves within and around technology?


## Material for Friday -
### What is GOOP? (or an introduction to prototyping living matter)

The teaching team is excited to share with you a unique prototyping platform for engineering living matter:

After this introduction you should be able to: 
Describe what is GOOP and how it works
Describe the role of prototyping in the engineering cycle 
Get ready to to apply and use GOOP (apply and build with the central dogma of biology)  
Be ready to use PyMol to visualize protein structures
 
Let’s begin:

**Q.0.** In preparation for class on Friday, please download PyMol using the following [link](https://pymol.org/2/). PyMol is a molecule visualization toolkit that is heavily used by protein engineers and designers. 

You are now familiar with the engineering cycle of design, build, and test. 
Until recently our ability to rapidly and robustly build prototypes for the engineering of living matter was somewhat limited. This is in contrast with other fields, where prototyping is a major component. For example, in electrical engineering circuits and systems are either prototyped (with physical components) or simulated. 3D printing is another example of prototyping that you may be familiar with. 

**Q.1** What are the consequences of limited prototyping? Think about an example in engineering living matter and in another engineering field. 

Thanks to recent developments in bioengineering, for the first time we have the ability to prototype engineering living matter as part of the class. (We have to emphasize that developing with and creating these prototyping platforms themselves is still an active and exciting area of research in bioengineering.)


### What is GOOP? 

The tubes in your kit contain GOOP: Genetic Objects Operations and Programming mixture. With GOOP you can test your genetic program (similar to genes you ordered during the build class) on a timescale of hours instead of days (to be explained shortly). Your programs or input instructions (designs) are small pieces of (circular) DNA called plasmids. Each plasmid contains the instructions to encode a protein: a type of complex macromolecule that can perform an incredible diversity of tasks. The GOOP in the tube runs your DNA instructions. GOOP is extracted cellular machinery, in this case from E. coli cells, that makes proteins from the DNA inputs needing living cells. The name of the specific material that you have is 
TX-TL, for transcription-translation. What are transcription and translation? Read on.


### The Central Dogma of Biology

At the core of biology is a simple idea, known as the central dogma. For our purpose, we can think of central dogma as a process that transcribes the information encoded in DNA to RNA (transcription), and then translates the information encoded in RNA to form a protein (translation). If you aren’t familiar with the central dogma, check out this video explain how it happens inside a cell (in vivo): Central Dogma. We’ve also listed some additional resources at the end of this document. Figure. 1 describes the overall flows of this process, which is typically from DNA to RNA to protein (with some special exceptions). 

**Figure-1 here** 
How is this related to GOOP? GOOP lets you to operate this process outside of living cells in a tube (in vitro). In fact, you can think of GOOP as the vertical blue arrows in Figure 1. When you add your plasmid instructions to GOOP and let it sit at room temperature, the GOOP will transcribe your DNA into messenger RNA, and translate it into the encoded proteins. This process will take a number of hours (up to overnight), but you will be able to see the real-time production of your protein product. In comparison, running a plasmid in cells requires a multi-step process that takes multiple days, requires more complex plasmid design, and needs more sophisticated lab equipment (although it does have some advantages, can you think of any?). If you’re interested in the in vivo approach, make sure to check out BIOE 44

**Q.2** What designs (devices, circuits or systems) you would like to build and test with GOOP? 

**Q.3** What do you think are some of the advantages and some of the disadvantages of prototyping living matter in GOOP? 

**Q.4** Why might a certain design work in GOOP and not inside a cell?

**Q.5** Why might some designs work in a cell but not in GOOP?

**Q.6**  In class on Friday, you will be instructed on how to use GOOP to express a fluorescent protein. Please read this web page to get a primer on what Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is and how it can be used in bioengineering applications: http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/42


### General Kit Operation 


1. Select the DNA parts you would like to use for each reaction and lay them out. Each part has been pre-measured in its tube.

2. Take the number of reaction tubes you need for the experiment out of the fridge or your insulated envelope.

3. Using the transfer pipettes, suck up each DNA part and transfer it into the appropriate reaction tube.
- Use a fresh pipette for each part transfer: DNA is a powerful molecule, and cross-contamination of even a tiny amount of one part into the wrong tube could lead to an unexpected outcome.
- Avoid creating bubbles: don’t squeeze too hard and suck up lots of air, and squeeze air out of the tip of the pipette before you lower it into the reaction mix.
- It may help to gently stir the reaction with the tip of a pipette once the parts have all been added.

4. If you need to add an input to the reaction—for example, an sample or an inducer—use a transfer pipette to add it as above.

5. Make sure all parts and the reaction mix are together in the bottom of the tube by holding it in your hand, extending your arm up, and rapidly moving it down, kind of like you’re throwing a baseball.
  - Don’t actually throw the tube.
  
6. Let the reactions run at room temperature. Depending on the reaction, you will begin to see visible changes after 6 hours. 

### Safety

Whenever we practise the engineering of living matter, we always want to consider the safety of what we’re doing, how we are doing it, and how it might affect others and the environment. 

In general, GOOP itself is safe because it not living and so cannot replicate, and because it is derived from an organism (E. coli K-12) that is Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1). BSL-1 organisms are those which are well-characterized and do not cause disease in healthy humans. 

Because GOOP operates genetic programs, some sets of instructions may have additional potential to cause harm: compare DNA encoding a colorful protein to DNA encoding a toxin. We will not supply genetic code that could hurt you, and our GOOP prototyping modules will each contain a section on any specific considerations for that module. There are some proteins that are illegal to make. Also note that there are industry standards for the synthesis of DNA programs: what do you think about this as a means of promoting safety?

Finally, there are several specific instructions for the safe operation of GOOP:
Don’t eat it!
Don’t get it in your eyes!
Dispose of GOOP by closing the tubes and throwing it in the trash.

Contact your TAs if you have any specific questions.

### Conclusion

Congratulations. In this module:
- You were introduced to the importance of prototyping in the context of engineering living matter.
- You began to consider how we can use GOOP to apply and build with central dogma without using living cells.
- You considered the advantages and current challenges associated with cell-free systems such as GOOP.
- You considered the safety of biological prototyping with regard to yourself and the environment.
- You downloaded molecular visualization toolkit PyMol

Now you are ready to proceed to the in class activity where you will use GOOP to express your first DNA code.
