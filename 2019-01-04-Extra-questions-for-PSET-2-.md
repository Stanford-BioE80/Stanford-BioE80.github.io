**Q.1.a.** How does Mosis work? Specifically, what key feature(s) makes this service better than others that had previously been used? (<150 words)

**Q.1.b. **If you were designing a chip, what advantage does Mosis provide? Why would you choose to use it? (<150 words)

* **[Nekta**r](http://www.nektar.com/) **[MycoWork**s](http://www.mycoworks.com/)

**Q.1.d.** Visit the Free Genes Project website. Briefly describe how does it work? (<150 words) Who is responsible for each aspect? 

As mentioned earlier *E. coli* is often used in bioengineering either as a model organism (to be studied or engineered directly) or as a host to generate large copies of user defined DNA. You will see (and setup your own in BIOE44) cultures tubes of* E. coli *(with medium- food for bacteria)* *often growing overnight on shaking incubators (set to 37C). (See **_Figure 2_**. from the book* Cell Biology by the Numbers. *You can get a free copy of the draft version of the book from this [link](http://book.bionumbers.org/))

**_Figure 2._*** E. coli* grown to saturation (after 8-12 hours)  (source for the figure is the book* Cell Biology by the Numbers*). ( *E. coli *divides about every 20 mins)

**Q.2.i. **Under the saturated condition, what percentage of the total volume (medium) is occupied by cells? 

The *E. coli* MG1655 genome is 4.6 Mbp (mega base pairs) long, or approximately 4,600,000 base pairs. A good rule of thumb for the length of a single DNA base pair is that it is ⅓ nm long.

**Q.2.c.** How long would the *E. coli* genome be as a linear strand of DNA?  Provide your answer in µm.

**Q.2.d. **The *E. coli* genome is actually circular. What is the radius of the genome, assuming the genome is arranged as a perfect circle and given the linear length that you calculated above?

**Q.2.e.** Consider your answers in relation to the size specifications for *E. coli* given above. What does this imply about the layout of DNA inside a living cell? (Two sentences)**. **A good rule of thumb for the volume of a DNA base pair is that one base pair has a volume of approximately 1 nm3.** **

**Q.2.f. ** How much DNA could be packed into an *E. coli* cell, assuming that the whole cell volume only contains DNA?

**Q.2.g. **Why is this number ridiculous? (i.e., the *E. coli* genome is significantly smaller: why?)

(As a rule of thumb, let's treat a bacterial cell volume as being approximately 1 µm3. Note that this is a rough, order-of-magnitude estimate. In real life, cell size and volume will vary based upon species, growth rate, and stage of division in addition to many other factors.)

In your own words, in one sentence, what does the given resolution value mean?

**Q.5.b.** Describe what you are seeing: What is being tested, and by whom? What methods are they using? What data are being collected?

**Q.5.c.** How do you think the data was used? 

Interestingly, although the validation of a design/build through testing is the only method through which can determine our success, failure is not widely discussed in our society. 

**Q.4.d. **Give an example of a biological experiment you might conduct where using *both* GFP and your selected fluorescent protein could be useful. Describe the experiment in no more than a few sentences. Draw upon what you've learned about how fluorescent proteins are expressed using DNA constructs (genes).
