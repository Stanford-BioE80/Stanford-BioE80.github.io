Welcome to the pre-class material for Stanford Intro. to Bioengineering Day 4!

Please read and consider the below before start of class on: 

**Monda****y 9 April 2018.**

The questions given are only study questions not homework to be answered.

Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

How do engineers actually engineer with, of, and for biology?

* * *


Here you will examine the role of the core engineering cycle -- "Design, Build, and Test" -- and specifically its application to engineering with, of, and for living matter. After considering the following examples and class next week... 

**Goal-1:** You will be able to describe the engineering cycle, design-build-test (DBT), and the central role it plays in (bio)engineering, and how DBT can be utilized at different scales (from one person to whole industry sectors).

**Goal-2 :** When faced with a challenge, you will be able to articulate your goal, 

specify your design needs, and develop a plan for designing, building, and testing your 

solution.

**Goal-3: **By the end of this week, you will be able to describe the DBT framework as a dynamic process in response to the current needs (social, technological, environmental, etc.), and begin to consider what DBT will look like in the future. 

Let's begin:

## **Example 1 | What does it mean to "Engineer a Solution"?**

* * *


Every day we make innumerable choices about how to act, how to manage our time, how to complete a tough question in a problem set, what we should eat for lunch, and so on. Each decision we make forms a solution, a choice that we "enact to solve the problems in front of us. But have you ever thought about the decision process itself: How do we provide a solution to a problem? In our lives, the choices might be simple. Even when they're challenging (“I have one day to complete 5 assignments. How will I do it??") and the consequences are mitigated. But what about if the solution you’re engineering is a resolution of global hunger? Or a new cancer therapeutic with little-to-no side effects? Here, when the stakes are high and the options are limitless a common (and incredibly important) framework - the** Design-Build-Test (DBT) cycle** - can help us wade through the choices and toward success ([image](http://www.makemyownsite.com/loc_ms/step4_test.html)). 

As a specific example to start with, [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/about) is a charity that has a unique approach to the alleviation of wants and needs. Instead of soliciting donations, Kiva provides a platform for individuals and groups around the world to request loans for their cause, empowering them to build a better future for themselves, their families, and their community.

**Take a few minutes to browse the Kiva website, noting the geographic location of the groups you see and their goals.**

** Q.1.  What is your initial response to the Kiva platform? Do you find anything striking?**

Kiva breaks down into different topics, allowing the potential lender to filter by the topic they find the most compelling. Looking at a few of the most common loan requests and we can extract a general structure:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Campaign...</td>
    <td>Goal / Use of Loan...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cruz Celina, Hùng, Loan</td>
    <td>Buying materials to build a latrine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Channy's Group, Sreymai’s Group</td>
    <td>Buying water filters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jane’s Group, Sin Kyoe(2)D Village Group, Zulaykha
</td>
    <td>Buying fertilizer, seed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kantiembou Group, Dumitru, Glenda, Zhanybek</td>
    <td>Buying livestock</td>
  </tr>
</table>


This focuses on solving problems immediately by providing (consuming) products as they currently exist. In this class, we have the opportunity to step outside the bounds of current offerings by thinking about **designing** and **building better** products that fix unmet **needs**.

The first step toward this different approach requires us to really understand why the current solution is being used. To do that, let's consider the loans above that ask for money to buy livestock. Why? Because while we haven’t all necessarily raised livestock on a farm, many of us have interacted with animals in some way.

Think about how we - as humans - interact with all types of animals: cats, dogs, horses, cows, sheep, etc. What resources do we get from these interactions? What functions could the animals be serving in our lives? Below is a list of some of the traditional (and more contemporary) human-animal interactions:

1. *Companionship - the sheep could be their pets*

2. *Transportation - riding horses, etc *

3. *Food - meat, dairy, eggs, etc*

4. *Cloth - wool from sheep,*

5. *Income - reselling of animals*

**Q.2. For each of the uses above, could you replace the function the animal serves with another solution/product? If yes, how?**

**Q.3. Think about when you might choose to use either the animal or your alternative approach.**

For example, consider the [Kantiembou Group](https://www.kiva.org/lend/1486507). Aissata wants to buy sheep with a loan from Kiva supporters. 

**Q.4. What function are the sheep serving? (What did Aissata plan to do with the sheep?)**

**Q.5. Revisit your ideas about how to replace this function. Would it be applicable in this case? Why or why not? How would you refine your idea given this specific circumstance/use case?**

Now that we have begun to think outside the box, let's analyze in a broader sense the merits of each approach. While this example was used to help you relate to and begin to engage with the initial considerations of the Design-Build-Test cycle, it is not meant to belittle the massive progress toward correcting global injustices that has been enabled by attempts to provide immediate aid. With any problem - whether engineering a solution to social need or engineering a protein in the lab - there are multiple meritorious approaches. It is important to understand these merits, their limitations, and when they can and should be utilized. 

**Q.6. ****What are the pros and cons of providing access to current products (donating money, products themselves) versus changing the products to better address needs? **(Think of some considerations that would determine which approach you would use, such as resources you would need, time to completion, how easy it would be to implement, and how each would impact the stakeholders/people involved.)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Approach | Providing access to current resources (/solutions/products)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Approach | Creating new products (/solutions)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros</td>
    <td>Cons</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Faced with numerous pros and cons, it can be difficult to decide upon "the best" course of action. Luckily, the Design-Build-Test cycle provides a powerful framework to help refine the engineering of a solution.

## **Example 2 | Bioengineering via Design-Build-Test**

* * *


What if, in a few years, you were given $35 million to fund clinical trials of a medicine based on one of your undergraduate bioengineering research projects? Applying Design-Build-Test appropriately can make this possible.  For example...

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine that is triggered by eating gluten - a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye - and causes damage to the fingerlike projections lining your small intestine (villi) important for nutrient absorption ([figure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220)). It is estimated that 1% of the US population has celiac disease, but despite increasing attention in the media, almost 83% of those 3 million people remain undiagnosed (NOTE:  Beyond Celiac: What is Celiac Disease?). While misdiagnosis is common, some postulate that this lack of diagnosis (and awareness) can be linked to the limited clinical treatment offerings: currently, the only approved therapy is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. Avoiding gluten can be difficult when there are hidden sources lurking around us (NOTE:  Medivizor: 300 facts you didn't know about gluten). Further, many who do adhere to a strict gluten-free diet do not see recovery of the small intestinal mucosa.

Recognizing the need for a true therapy, a 2011 undergraduate iGEM team (see igem.org) from the University of Washington began to design a drug that could potentially provide relief. Six years later, that drug (KumaMax) was funded to undergo phase I clinical trials to the tune of $35 million.  To learn more skim the following two websites:

[iGEM Startup PvP Biologics Closes a $35 Million Agreement with Pharmaceutical Company Takeda](https://synbiobeta.com/igem-startup-pvp-biologics-closes-35-million-agreement-pharmaceutical-company-takeda/), 

[UW iGEM Wiki: Gluten Destruction](http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Celiacs/Background),

**Q.7. According to the team's website, why had other approaches failed? **

**Q.8. What was unique about their approach?**

**Q.9. How did they choose their starting enzyme? What key design specification made this a great choice?**

**Q.10. How did they design their enzyme? What tools did they use?**

**Q.11. How did they test their enzyme?**

**Q.12. What would you have done differently?**

This example highlights the power of the DBT framework applied to a bioengineering challenge. The students began with an enzyme that, by correctly navigating a DBT process, they were able to engineer into modified form that could breakdown gluten in the gut.

**Summary**

* * *


In this pre-class activity you were introduced to the engineering cycle: design, build, and test and its application to bioengineering. You utilized a needs finding approach to identify design constraints, and specifications to describe your designs and corresponding tests. You examined the application of this approach to real world challenges. Finally you practiced an application of DBT framework through the Celiac disease case study. In class this week you will be introduced to how to actually design, build and test biomolecules.

**Keywords:**

* **Design-Build-Test Cycle | **a framework that provides structure to the process of engineering a solution to diverse problems.

    * **Design | **developing a possible solution. Informed by your design specifications. 

    * **Needs**** | **the specific problem you would like to solve. 

    * **Design Specifications | **how your solution will behave. For example: I'm building a paper plane for the purpose of nudging awake your friend across the room. This plane needs to:

        * Fly straight for 5 feet

        * Be smaller than 4 inches across (to be inconspicuous)

        * Weigh less than one ounce (you don't want to hurt your friend)

        * Be recyclable (because you love the earth)

    * **Build | **making a prototype. I.e., make your design in real life. 

    * **Test | **Check whether your design, when turned into reality, actually satisfies all of requirements.
