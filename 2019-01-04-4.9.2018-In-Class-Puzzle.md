Stanford Intro. to Bioengineering Day 4

In-class puzzle for start of class on: 

**Monday 9 April 2018.**

* * *


How do engineers engineer with, of, and for biology?

* * *


Puzzle Questions: (drafts, pick however many are needed)

* Q1 (True / False): The framework of design-build-test - while integral to engineering fields - can be used to engineer solutions to diverse problems, whether engineering a tangible object in a lab or developing a plan to alleviate widespread social need. 

* Q2 (True / False): The DBT process, if done correctly, helps you get to your goal on the first try. Which is good because it doesn't help you improve if you were to fail. 

* Q3 (True / False): Building off an iGem project, the team behind KumaMax used a unique approach to the development of a biologic therapeutic that alleviates diabetes. 

* Q4 (True / False): Mutations to Kumamolisin-As were modeled using the computational protein folding tool FoldIt.

* Q5 (True / False): The wild-type (original, found in nature) version of KumaMax actually didn't have specificity for gliadins. 

* Q6 (True / False): The wild-type version of KumaMax (Kumamolisin-As) was primarily chosen because it is active at low pH, making it a good match for the conditions in the small intestine. 

Q -- Kiva is a web platform that allows people to crowdfund presents and other non-essential purchases using Amazon's online gift registry system.

Q -- New or improved drugs can only be developed by project managers at big pharmaceutical companies.

Q -- The wild-type version of KumaMax (Kumamolisin-As) was primarily chosen because it is active at low pH, making it a good match for the conditions in the small intestine.
