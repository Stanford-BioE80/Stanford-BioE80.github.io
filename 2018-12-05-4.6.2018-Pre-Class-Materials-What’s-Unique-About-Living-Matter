**Welcome to the pre-class material for Stanford Intro. to Bioengineering Day 3!**

Please read and consider the below before start of class on **Friday 6 April 2018**.

The questions given are only study questions not homework to be graded.

Talk about it all with your classmates, friends, or TAs, as you like.

**What's Unique About Living Matter?*** * *


Here you will learn and think about what makes living matter such a unique material when compared to inert matter when considering its properties and capabilities.

**Goal:** After watching the following video you should be able to explain the properties of living matter that make it more effective at solving many engineering challenges compared to inert matter.

Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/NpZ3PXTnxdw) from Prof. Liphardt detailing the unique properties of living matter. Write down any questions you have so you can ask your peers, TA's, and professors in class or office hours.

**Q.1. Think of at least two more applications which could benefit from the use of living matter that weren't mentioned in the video.**

**Q.2. According to the video, what is the universal code that makes engineering and tinkering with living matter feasible? **

**Q.3. Describe what it means that living matter functions and is organized on many orders of magnitude (multiple scales). Think about an additional example (video discusses the brain) ****to explain organization from nanometers to meters to scale.**

**Q.4. What did y****o****u find m****o****st surprising? **

**Self-Assessment | Maker or Explorer *** * *


Imagine that you spend hours assembling a device ( a box ) that, once finished, is supposed to power a light bulb when a button is pushed. You place your finished construction on your workshop table and press the button... POOF! Smoke pours from the device but the bulb remains dark. Do you exclaim (choose one):

 			

DARN!!! 		COOL!!!

Why did you pick your choice? Remember your answer for the class on Friday.

**Foldscope *** * *


In the activity on Friday you will be making your own Foldscope (engineering for living matter similar to Anton van Leeuwenhoek)  and use it to explore and discover the world around you. You will be going outside during class so wear appropriate shoes and jacket.

Watch the following three videos to prepare for the foldscope activity.

1. Dr. Manu Prakash's vision for the paper microscope back in 2012. [Link ](https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami#t-545437)

2. Instructions for how to use the foldscope with a smartphone. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpeJUbs32VU)

3. Instructions for how to build the foldscope (You will be doing this in class). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvZRO36IRYY)
