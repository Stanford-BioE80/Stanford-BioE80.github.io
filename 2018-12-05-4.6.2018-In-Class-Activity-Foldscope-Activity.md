**In Class Activity - Foldscope: **

**Be a Naturalist |  Be a Maker**

Recall from the safety training that the UTL space (our undergraduate learning lab space) requires that shoes must cover the entire foot and pants must cover the ankle. Leave food and drinks on the cart outside. 

**A. Introduction  **

Welcome to Foldscope activity! We hope that you are as excited as we are!

Our goal is to help you discover and get you inspired by the living matter and world around you. 

**In class goal: **Build your own foldscope.

To complete this activity you will first build your own simple microscope, similar to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, and use it to explore and discover the world around you. Your microscope is called a **Foldscope**. (If you would like to learn about the story behind Foldscope go to this [link](https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami#t-545437))

Using your own Foldscope, you will discover the world around you by going outside and taking microscopic pictures of stuff that fascinates you (living matter and otherwise). It does not matter what you take a picture of and the teaching team purposefully won't give you a direction. We want you to explore for yourself and interact with what you find interesting.  

Finally, you are asked to document and share your images. This will be part of your PSET-1. This can be completed today or anytime in the next week (PSET-1 is due 4/13)

**B. Build your own Foldscope:**

Your Foldscope kit has a manual which will guide you through its construction. 

However, if you would like a video tutorial please visit the Foldscope website [here](https://www.foldscope.com/foldscope-instructions/). TAs will be available during the activity (Friday 4/6, Shriram 112 and 132) session to help you with building your Foldscope as well. Instructions for how to use the foldscope with a smartphone can be found on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpeJUbs32VU).

*****************To checkout of class have a TA confirm your Foldscope is made*****************

**C. Where to go next: **

There are several great spots on campus to explore. For this activity you can explore the variety of plant life outside (even the engineering quad has plants to discover!) or explore indoor treasures such as your food or samples from your body. 

The four main types of plant life you will find in the Engineering Quad include:

	Historic Native American (Ohlone Tribe Plants)

	Plants for pigments and dyes 

	Plants for Biofuels 

	Plants as food for birds and people 

You can also get inspired by looking at the global community of explorers that are using Foldscope and see examples of their posts from here:

**D. Guiding questions to think about as you explore **

1. Based on what you've seen and taken a picture of, what type of invention or pattern have you observed?

2. What was the most surprising/unexpected moment during your adventure?

3. From your exploration, what ideas or thoughts come up in your mind (either as a bioengineer or a citizen of a bioengineered world)?

**E. Grading Scheme **

There is a question based on the Foldscope activity on your PSET-1. Participation during class is part of that question (and your grade). Specifically we will ask:

Did you show up on Friday April 6th, build your Foldscope, and have a TA check it?

The second part of the question will ask you to use your Foldscope and either be an explorer or to be a maker - in search of discoveries or inspiration for new bioengineered machines. You have to write a summary of going through this process and add photos that you took. If you want you can start now, and begin your exploration.
