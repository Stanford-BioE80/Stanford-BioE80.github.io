### **From Kumamolisin-As to KumaMax**

**Idea behind KumaMax:**

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/zqA0ut4us4iWLbw32S0aGg_img_0.gif)

Taken from ([1](https://pubs-acs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja3094795)): "Figure 1. Schematic depicting the role of enzyme therapeutics in the treatment of celiac disease. Gluten is comprised of many glycoproteins including α-gliadin. Partial proteolysis of α-gliadin results in protease-resistant peptides enriched in a PQ dipeptide motif that can lead to inflammation and disease. An enzyme that is functional in the stomach and capable of specifically degrading the immunogenic peptides could potentially act as a therapeutic for this disease."

**Idea: what if we start by walking the students through DBT of an OET for celiac disease?**

From ref 1: "An ideal oral enzyme therapeutic (OET) for celiac disease would have the following traits: 

(1) optimal activity at the pH of the stomach after a meal (in the range of 2–4);([7](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.stanford.idm.oclc.org/pubmed/11796648?dopt=Abstract)) 

(2) resistance to common digestive proteases; 

(3) facile recombinant production in a soluble form; and 

(4) specificity for the common proline–glutamine (PQ) motif found in immunogenic α-gliadin oligopeptides.([6](https://pubs-acs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/servlet/linkout?suffix=ref6/cit6&dbid=16&doi=10.1021%2Fja3094795&key=10.1126%2Fscience.1074129), [8](https://pubs-acs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1021/pr050173t))"
