**Stanford BIOE/ENGR.80		In-Class Activity (TOOL KIT)		4 April 2018**

**Welcome to the In-class material for Stanford Intro. to Bioengineering Day 2!**

** **

Today we'll ask you to think about emergent activities (i.e., case studies) arising within or associated to bioengineering.  Weâ€™d like you to work in small groups (~3 people). As you are discussing and brainstorming please work to ground your answers in the real possibilities. Feel free to use the internet and the TAs to help develop and debate your positions.  As a tool for considering each case we outline below three different aspects of how bioengineering can have impacts.  

1. **Economy (how will we make things?)**

The industrial revolution dramatically shaped how products were made in the US and around the world and therefore had a large impact on the global economy. When you think about the current material flow in most industries, there is a centralization of industrial capacity centered around factories' ability to produce products at the scale that we need.

Imagine how biology may create a more distributed economy wherein centralized production may not always be the most economical or practical. For example, what if the local pharmacy can produce drugs on demand, or individuals could make the things they need in their own homes?

As more detailed questions related to a future bio-enabled economy please consider:

1. **Describe daily life scenarios that you would be excited about in this biological production based economy. Emphasize how your new suggestions are different from the current production model.**

2. **Will such models of manufacturing align well with existing markets? What would an economy look like wherein some physical products are free to make?**

3. **What challenges would you envision in creating an economy like the one described?**

2. **Security (how will we hurt each other?)**

WWI and WWII had completely different wartime strategies largely due to differences in weapon and transportation technologies available at the time. In WWI trenches were used to slowly advance the front lines using machine guns, artillery, chemical weapons, and slow armored vehicles. WWII was no longer a war with long static front lines as, for example, tanks and airplanes increased the mobility and maneuverability of the troops.

Now think about how engineering living matter might influence war tactics and how our physical security might be changed. For examples click this link to see  the full genome of the 1918 flu that infected up to one third of the world population a century ago:

1. **What is the difference between safety and security? **

2. **How does one prepare differently for safety concerns versus security concerns?  **

3. **Who should have access to tools for engineering living matter? How (or should) it be controlled?**

4. **Should we be concerned with bad actors (individuals, groups, or countries) using biology to purposefully cause harm?**

3. **Humanity (what will it mean to be human?)**

	Humans as individual biological organisms have historically been defined, literally, by a natural reproductive process in which the genetic material of our parents leads to us as individuals, and so on.  Increasingly it is becoming apparent that we can assert our intention into the human reproductive process.  E.g., ~4% of humans born in the US today arise and arrive via in-vitro fertilization.  At the on-campus children's hospital it is now standard practice for the DNA of the fetus to be partially sequenced as 10 weeks post fertilization in order to screen for various genetic conditions, and this information is used to inform health decisions.  Others are now beginning to apply advanced genetic engineering tools to edit genes within viable human embryos, although no such embryos have yet been implanted and brought to full term.  

With all this in mind, please consider the following questions:

1. **What does it mean to be human? **

2. **Who do you consider yourself to be? **

3. **How could (or should) our access to advanced bioengineering tools and approaches change your answers to these questions?**
